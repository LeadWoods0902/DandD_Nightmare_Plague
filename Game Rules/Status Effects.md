## Bleed
A status effect that can be applied to all creatures with less than a 5 \[CON\]mod

After proccing a number (10+2*\[CON\]mod) of stacks, the enemy loses (6-\[CON\]mod (positive value)) health per round. 

A creature loses \[CON\]mod of bleed stacks per round. A creature stops bleeding when it has no remaining bleed stacks.

Once a creature has started bleeding, it's bleed stacks will only decrease until reaching zero. It will have one round of immunity and will then become susceptible on the following round.
