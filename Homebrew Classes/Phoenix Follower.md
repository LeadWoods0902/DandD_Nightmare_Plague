### Spell Slots
The Phoenix Mage table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

The Spells Known column of the Phoenix Mage table shows when you learn more Sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Sorcerer spells, since your magic draws from the power of the Phoenix within you. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Sorcerer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

- **Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier**
- **Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier**
