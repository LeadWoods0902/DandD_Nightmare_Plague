Trailblazer’s Coded Language

Trailblazers use a coded language of symbols and markings to communicate vital information about paths, dangers, and safe locations. Learning this language requires a dedicated mentor and can take months of practice. The symbols are often hidden in plain sight, carved into trees, painted on rocks, or subtly altered in the landscape. These marks can indicate anything from the direction to the nearest safe water source to warnings of dangerous creatures nearby.
Playing a Trailblazer

As a Trailblazer, your role in a party is to ensure safe passage through hazardous areas, find hidden resources and shelters, and use your knowledge of secret trails to gain tactical advantages. Whether you're guiding a group of adventurers through a deadly forest, finding a hidden cave in a snowstorm, or marking the way for others to follow, your skills are invaluable in the wild. You are the unseen guardian of the wilderness, a master of survival, and the keeper of secrets that can mean the difference between life and death.
modify the class so that it gains some combat skills. The given class presents the correct theme but would lead to a player being significantly underpowered in combat unless multiclassing. Some of the abilities could relate to being prepared to fight a type of creature(s), perhaps through having seen trail markers indicating the presence of a nearby beast (ie advantage on saving throws against a beast that they saw a warning for)
