# Important NPCs
## Elaine Gjalla
Close-Friend and aide to The Mistress of Brokvar; Elaine was sent to meet Chancellor Sturgis, his daughter and their companion Duska Von Mori in Virmarr to escort them safely to the capital. But after a series of chance encounters, Elaine returned to Brokvar with more than was bargained for: with the amnesiac, the enslaved and the broken minded in tow, Elaine returned to her Mistress.

Elaine is a competent fighter, seemingly capable of commanding the elements around her: during an encounter with a gravolith, Elaine summoned a swirling wind to protect Sturgis & Hinelle and a large bolt of lightning which she skilfully struck the discovered weak-point of the gravolith with.
