# Important NPCs
## Elaine Gjalla
### Description
Close-Friend and aide to The Mistress of Brokvar. Elaine seems to be well known and respected amongst the community.
### Highlights
Elaine was sent to meet Chancellor Sturgis, his daughter and their companion Duska Von Mori in Virmarr to escort them safely to the capital. But after a series of chance encounters, Elaine returned to Brokvar with more than was bargained for: with the amnesiac, the enslaved and the broken minded in tow, Elaine returned to her Mistress.

Elaine is a competent fighter, seemingly capable of commanding the elements around her: during an encounter with a gravolith, Elaine summoned a swirling wind to protect Sturgis & Hinelle and a large bolt of lightning which she skilfully struck the discovered weak-point of the gravolith with.

## Mistress
### Description
A seemingly important lady of Brokvar, her connection to the city and its people is murky but she seems to hold power over those around her.
Her true identity is seemingly unknown to all but herself, her reasons for doing so equally obscured
### Highlights
Her first meeting with the party was brief; however, she seemingly had the ability to see right through each member, identifying their problems as if pre-inclined to their plights. During the night, she was taken busy with an emergency meeting and was hence pre-disposed for the following days. Upon her return, she met with the party again (well, the party interrupted her meeting with the Moss family), suggesting that they partake in the mayoral campaign happening later in the day.
