Shards of the trident embed themselves within Mazikeen's body - the shards pin her soul to her body, preventing it from leaving. Effectively, Mazikeen is immortal while the shards remain inside her - without them, her soul will leave. As a consequence of her soul being unable to pass into the soul realm, the souls of recently deceased relatives are magnetised towards her - however the shards that are keeping her soul from leaving also prevent others from binding. The souls, now in the mortal plane attach to a nearby host of matching blood - a bastard of Lucius' who he had while in Brokvar during the war
