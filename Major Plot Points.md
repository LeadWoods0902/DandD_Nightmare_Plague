The spell effect is still substantial and Alaric's weaker body takes the brunt of the force. Shards of the trident embed themselves within Mazikeen's body - the shards pin her soul to her body, preventing it from leaving. Effectively, Mazikeen is immortal while the shards remain inside her - without them, her soul will leave. As a consequence of her soul being unable to pass into the soul realm, the souls of recently deceased relatives are magnetised towards her - however the shards that are keeping her soul from leaving also prevent others from binding. The souls, now in the mortal plane attach to a nearby host of matching blood - a bastard of Lucius' who he had while in Brokvar during the war

The following morning, Mazikeen awakes to find a strange woman offering to give her help - with no other plan to recover her memory, Mazikeen accepts. Entering the Common Room it becomes apparent that the strange lady is with Duska, the woman from the night before - it is also readily apparent that the strange lady, who introduces herself now as Elaine has adopted a rag tag group of broken people. The group are told to ready to leave and grab anything they need in town.
