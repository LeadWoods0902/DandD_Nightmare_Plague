Shards of the trident embed themselves within Mazikeen's body - the shards pin her soul to her body, preventing it from leaving. Effectively, Mazikeen is immortal while the shards remain inside her - without them, her soul will leave. As a consequence of her soul being unable to pass into the soul realm, the souls of recently deceased relatives are magnetised towards her - however the shards that are keeping her soul from leaving also prevent others from binding. The souls, now in the mortal plane attach to a nearby host of matching blood - a bastard of Lucius' who he had while in Brokvar during the war

###### Mazikeen's Story
Mazikeen awakens, with no memory of how or why they are there. While running in an attempt to escape, Mazikeen unleashes a wave of energy - a combination of the power of the trident and a part of her soul. This causes her to fall into unconsciousness and collapse, rolling down a hill and into a river. Mazikeen awakens outside of the town of Virmarr and stumbles towards the nearest source of light and warmth. Mazikeen arrives at the copper cask and collapses in front of Duska and the matron of the tavern Brovarra. The two take her to a bed and watch her for the night. The following morning, Mazikeen awakes to find a strange woman offering to give her help - with no other plan to recover her memory, Mazikeen accepts. Entering the Common Room it becomes apparent that the strange lady is with Duska, the woman from the night before - it is also readily apparent that the strange lady, who introduces herself now as Elaine has adopted a rag tag group of broken people. The group are told to ready to leave and grab anything they need in town. After a brief stint of exploration, Mazikeen witnesses Elain being shouted out of the mayor's house who she'd visited during their excursion. Leaving Virmarr, the party travel north for a day, camping in the evening on the edge of The Weald. Before settling down, Mazikeen overhears a conversation between Elaine and Sturgis - a man that was travelling with Duska. During the conversation, Mazikeen hears the two discussing the man's plans: how he is to represent a foreign power in the first royal election of Brokvar. After returning to the campfire, Mazikeen attempts to sleep but is unable to, her mind filled with an aura of death and hatred. During the night, a sound awakens the party and it is revealed that they've made camp in a Gravolith's territory. The rocks surrounding them are actually a part of a living being composed of natural rock. A fight ensues but after an impressive performance by Bismuth, the beast turns and flees - unfortunately for Bismuth, the creature flees with his axe embedded in it's rear.
