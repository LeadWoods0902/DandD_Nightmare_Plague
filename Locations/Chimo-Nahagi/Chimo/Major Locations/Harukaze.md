A small community nestled in a bowl on the edge of [[The Forest of Mori]] surrounded on three sides by woodland, the main road from Harukaze follows the river downhill towards the great plains of [[Hayatsuyu]] and [[Satsukiya]]

During a recent winter, [[Bismuth Shatterborne]] and [[Jasper Shatterborne]] rejuvenated their farmland after it was sapped of all it's nutrients by a vigorous crop that was eventually wiped about by disease. 

In the nearby woodlands, Bismuth & Jasper encountered a [[Wilderbeast]] and [[Kaede]].
