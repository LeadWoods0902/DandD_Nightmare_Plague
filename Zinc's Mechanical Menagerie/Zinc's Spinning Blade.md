### 3rd-level Conjuration
**Casting Time: 1 action**
**Range: 60 feet**
**Duration: 1 minute (Concentration)**
### Description
A floating, whirring blade manifests at a point within range and immediately flies in a straight line in the direction you choose. The blade moves at a speed of 45 feet per round. If it hits a solid surface, such as a wall, it rebounds and travels back along its original path. The blade continues this back-and-forth motion for the duration of the spell, slicing through anything in its way.
- **Damage**: The blade deals 2d8 slashing damage to any creature it passes through (Dexterity saving throw for half damage).
- **Control**: Once per turn, as a bonus action, you may alter the direction of the blade, sending it towards a new path or target.
- **Special**: The blade can bypass non-magical armour. It is also capable of damaging objects, cutting through non-magical barriers if given enough time. The spell ends if the blade travels beyond its range.
