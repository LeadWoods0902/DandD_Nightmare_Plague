## Major Points
- Bismuth & Jasper unknowingly bring a dormant Musoko to Senithar via The Kilfenora
	- Musoko is awakened due to proximity to the Coeden (& NÃ«oris): feeling under threat, Musoko summons minions to defend them in their weakened state. After realising the lack of threat Musoko escapes, taking the closest authority figure with them (Cpt. Nomli)
