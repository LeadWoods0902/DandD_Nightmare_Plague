Thank you for taking the time to visit me.

As you know, there is a reaver encampment in the islands north of here: "Gogledd-Ynys". It was once under the control of the Brokvarian Throne, comprising a large part of our export industry. Until a storm wrought destruction upon it, degrading into a haven for piracy. Intel indicates that they aim to attack the city during the coronation. I've alerted Commander Niahl of this and he's drawing reserves to the capital. Despite my best efforts, he is unwilling to spare soldiers to mount a counter-attack against their home while their defences are low. It is my belief that their queen, a woman known only as "The Blood-Tide" won't be partaking in the attack - intel suggests she holds a political role, banding several pirate groups together under one banner. Before she came to power, the groups spent more time fighting amongst themselves then raiding our shores - it is our concern that she wishes to expand her influence. Pressed between her reavers and the empire, we're not in a pretty place. Of the attacks they've mounted in the past, she's never shown face. Regardless of her presence, an attack on their stronghold could remove them from the islands and if she's there... removing their queen would lead to dissent in the ranks and they'd hopefully disband back into their own groups.

If you accept this mission, you'll be under the supervision of my son Ceinwen - he has proven himself in both battle and espionage: he's a born leader. I do understand however that you may not want to burden yourself with this matter, this is after all not your country

To you especially Bismuth, if you're looking for permanent employment, you are more than welcome to return to this keep - the service we provide is pivotal in maintaining the peace in Brokvar. Should any of the rest of you be interested, your abilities will be heartily welcome. If you need a little incentive, the open duchy is yours to traverse freely when you're not on shift and the pay I can offer is quite decent: especially compared to similar work you'd get in the capital.
