## Features
### Parasitic Aura 
At the start of each of the dwarf's turns, each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage, as the dark smoke siphons vitality.
### Regeneration 
The dwarf regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If it takes radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn. 
### Tentacle Reach 
The dwarf's reach is extended to 10 feet for its melee attacks due to the parasitic tentacles.

## Actions
### Multi-Attack
The smoke-touched dwarf makes two Tentacle Slam attacks
### Tentacle Slam
- *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. 
- *Hit*: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the dwarf can’t use its Tentacle Slam on another target.
### Corrupted Cleave
- *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10ft., one target.
- 18 (2d12 + 5) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target is slowed (as per the slow spell, but affecting only that creature). The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
### Smoky Eruption (Recharge 5-6) 
The dwarf releases a burst of dark smoke from its body. Each creature within 15 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save are also blinded until the end of their next turn.
### Shadow Transference
The dwarf can teleport up to 30 feet possessing a recently deceased corpse that it can see. The dwarf takes on the properties of the new host.

## Reactions
### Vengeful Strike
When the dwarf is hit by a melee attack, it can use its reaction to make one Tentacle Slam attack against the attacker.

---
## Lair Actions
### Thick Smoke
The air becomes filled with choking smoke. Each creature other than the dwarf that starts its turn within 20 feet of the dwarf must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. 
### Tentacle Trap
Shadowy tentacles emerge from the ground. Each creature within 10 feet of the dwarf must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of its next turn.
