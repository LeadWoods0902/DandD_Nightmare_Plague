## Features
### Immobile 
The tentacle cannot move but can attack any creature within 20 feet of it. It can still be moved or teleported by external means
### Regeneration 
The tentacle regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If it takes radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start of its next turn
### Tentacle Reach 
The tentacle’s reach is 20 feet for its melee attacks

## Actions
### Multi-Attack
The tentacle makes two Constricting Grasp attacks
### Constricting Grasp
- *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target
- *Hit*: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tentacle can’t grapple another target.
### Trip Slam
- *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target
- *Hit*: 9 (1d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
### Whip Smash (Recharge 5-6)
The tentacle violently lashes in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half damage and isn’t knocked prone.

### Burrow and Re-emerge (Recharge 5-6)
The tentacle sinks into the ground, becoming momentarily impervious to attacks and spells. Until the start of its next turn, the tentacle cannot be targeted or affected by any abilities, spells, or attacks.

At the start of its next turn, the tentacle reappears in an unoccupied space of the GM's choice within 30 feet of its previous location and can immediately make a Constricting Grasp or Trip Slam attack as part of this reemergence.

## Reactions
### Lashing Retaliation
When a creature within 20 feet of the tentacle hits it with an attack, the tentacle can make one Trip Slam attack against that creature.
