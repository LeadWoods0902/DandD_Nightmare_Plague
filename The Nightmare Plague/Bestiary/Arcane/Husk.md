A creature that's soul was stolen in some manner, for example: by a [[The Soul Golem||Soul Golem]]

##### Pallid Complexion: 
The most immediate and striking change is the pallor that sweeps over the husk's skin. The vibrant hues of life and vitality are drained away, leaving behind a sickly, ashen complexion. The skin takes on a papery quality, devoid of warmth or natural coloration.

##### Hollow Eyes: 
The eyes, once windows to the soul, now bear the most haunting transformation. The once expressive orbs become dark, lifeless voids, as if the light within has been extinguished. The gaze of a husk holds no emotion, no spark of recognition, only an abyss of emptiness.

##### Gaunt Features: 
The face of a husk takes on a gaunt and skeletal appearance. Cheeks hollow out, and the contours of the skull become more pronounced, giving the impression of perpetual hunger and longing.

##### Decrepit Posture: 
The body of a husk appears hunched and frail, as if burdened by an unbearable weight. Their once-strong and agile physique is reduced to a withered frame, signifying the loss of inner vitality and strength.

##### Hair Loss: 
Many husks experience a severe loss of hair, with it thinning or falling out entirely. Strands of hair may remain, but they are brittle and lackluster, further emphasizing the lifelessness that pervades their being.

##### Voiceless Utterance: 
When a husk attempts to speak, their voice carries an eerie, hollow quality. Words emerge as whispers from the void, devoid of emotion or resonance, leaving listeners with a sense of deep unease.

##### Limb Contortion: 
In some instances, the limbs of a husk may appear unnaturally twisted or contorted, as if their body is caught in a perpetual state of anguish or torment.
