## Attacks
**Slash:** 
## Racial Abilities
**Flight:** With a 10ft straight line start, the Owl-Cat can achieve flight. The Owl-Cat has a flying speed equal to its movement speed. The Owl-Cat can fly up to 20ft off the ground and can cross a gap of unlimited death up to 20ft wide

**Hoot of Confusion:** This ability can be quite powerful, potentially incapacitating enemies by causing them to attack themselves. The cost of 2 stamina is reasonable for its effect, and the range of 15 feet provides decent coverage.

**Screech of Terror:** Fear is a potent status condition, and imposing disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while also restricting movement toward the Owl-Cat can greatly hinder enemies. Again, the cost of 2 stamina seems balanced for this effect.

**Rending Laceration:** This ability offers consistent damage along with the potential for a debilitating status effect (bleeding). The cost of 2d4 slashing damage plus bleeding effect for 3 turns seems reasonable, though the DC for the Dexterity saving throw isn't provided, so it's hard to gauge its balance fully.

**Sundering Glare:** Disrupting spellcasters' concentration can be incredibly impactful in combat. The cost of 4 stamina is appropriate for such a potent effect, and the DC 12 Constitution saving throw provides a reasonable chance for spellcasters to resist.

**Swooping Dive:** Granting advantage on attacks from flight is a significant benefit, especially for a creature that likely relies on aerial tactics. The cost of 1 stamina is fair, and the ability to land safely after the attack adds to its tactical versatility.

**Whirlwind Buffet:** This ability provides utility in repositioning enemies, potentially disrupting their plans or pushing them into hazardous terrain. The cost of 1 stamina is appropriate for the effect.

**Supportive Assault:** Allowing the Owl-Cat to capitalize on its allies' successful attacks adds to its versatility and synergy with the party. The cost of 1 stamina is reasonable for the opportunity to deal additional damage.
