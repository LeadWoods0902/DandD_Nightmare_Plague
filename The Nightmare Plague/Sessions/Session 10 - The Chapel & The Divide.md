Sturgis' speech:
"Esteemed citizens of Brokvar, I come before you as a representative of Sunmaek, a culture that has woven its tale into the very fabric of your kingdom. Many years ago, Ven-Dryk, a Sunmaekean, ventured into the heart of Brokvar. Fate, as whimsical as it is, led him to the side of your queen, your Napella. Fate, as cruel as it is, took her from you too soon. Her legacy however has lived on in Ven-Dryk, under his stewardship, you have witnessed the resurgence of stability and prosperity within your beloved city. His commitment to the welfare of Brokvar has been unwavering. 

And now in this moment of transition, we extend a hand in friendship, seeking not dominance but collaboration. Our Buyuk, a title akin to queen, Emre , proposes a unique union between Sunmaek and Brokvar that aims to fortify the foundations of your city. Emre suggests the establishment of a governance structure that elects a new leader from the local populace - a leader who represents the will and common folk of Brokvar and through the support and wisdom of Emre and her esteemed advisors can drive Brokvar into a new age.

Picture a leader emerging from your own midst, someone intimately acquainted with the nuances of Brokvar, steering the ship with the backing of Emre Aydin and her council. It is a formula for success, a fusion of the strengths inherent in both our cultures. In this collaborative endeavour, you will not lose your identity; instead, you will find strength in unity. Emre envisions a realm where the unique tapestry of Brokvar is not only preserved but enhanced through the synergy of our shared strengths. Imagine a future where Sunmaek and Brokvar, working hand in hand, create a kingdom that stands as a testament to cooperation, resilience, and shared growth.

As Ven-Dryk steps aside, he leaves behind a legacy of stability and progress. Embrace this moment of transition as an opportunity to forge an alliance that not only honours the past but also propels both cultures towards a future of shared prosperity. Together, let us weave a new chapter in the tapestry of our intertwined historiesâ€”a chapter that speaks of unity, collaboration, and a boundless potential for greatness.
