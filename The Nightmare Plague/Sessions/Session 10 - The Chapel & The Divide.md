## Ven-Dryk’s Introduction:
People of Brokvar, for years we have endured trials and heartache. We’ve seen our queen, Napella, fall to foreign treachery, our lands occupied, our freedoms stripped away. But through resilience and unity, we reclaimed what was taken from us. Today, we stand not as subjects, but as citizens—ready to chart our own destiny.

This election is more than a choice of leadership; it is a choice of identity. It is a testament to our strength, our courage, and our will to be free. This election is not just about who will lead us, but how we will define ourselves as a people. It is about whether we choose to live in fear of our past or embrace the promise of a brighter future.

Let us remember those who sacrificed everything so we could be here today—the soldiers who fell, the innocents who suffered under Ymerodrine rule, and our beloved Queen, who gave her life for Brokvar. Let us honour them by making our voices heard, by choosing wisely. We will now hear from those who seek to lead us, those who wish to guide our beloved country forward into this new era. Each has a vision for Brokvar, and it is up to you, the people, to decide who will steer this ship through the turbulent waters ahead. May the candidates speak with the wisdom and love for Brokvar that it deserves.
## VD introduces OM
First, we will hear from a man who has stood as the unyielding sentinel of Brokvar’s borders, the shield that weathered the storm of occupation. Though the empire’s forces battered his duchy, he and his people never bowed, never broke. He knows what it means to protect this land, not just in word, but in deed. Please welcome Owain Moss, Duke of Deep Moss, and a stalwart defender of our nation.
## OM’s Speech:
Brokvar has always been a land of strength, of unyielding resolve. My ancestors stood watch at the borders, our guardsmen the first and last line of defence against those who would do us harm. But we faltered—betrayed by complacency, weakened by our own neglect. We failed to foresee the threat that lurked beyond our borders, and in that moment of weakness, the empire struck.

When the empire’s forces marched on our lands, we were not prepared. My own Deep Moss Duchy, the shield of Brokvar, found itself overwhelmed and outmatched. It was a bitter lesson, one that we paid for dearly in blood and loss. But even in the darkest days of occupation, when the imperial flag flew over our capital, the spirit of Brokvar was never broken. We never surrendered, never let them extinguish the flame of Brokvarian courage. In the deep woods and hidden valleys, we kept the fire alive.

But we have stood alone for too long, isolated in our defiance. It is time for a new order, one that honours our legacy while preparing for a future where every Brokvarian is as steadfast as the Deep Moss. We must rebuild our strength, restore the might of our borders, and ensure that never again will our enemies find us unprepared. I vow to make Brokvar a nation that no empire will dare challenge, a nation where the spirit of our people is as indomitable as the mountains and forests that cradle our homeland. This is the Brokvar I envision: strong, united, and unbreakable. But to achieve this, we must stand together, as one people, one nation.
## VD introduces FN
Our next candidate is a man I came to know well during my reign with Napella, while I must admit I was once dubious of the Neorian Path, he has shown me the strength, wisdom and compassion that your faith offers. He has shown me - and all of us here today - that true strength lies not solely in steel and strategy but in the heart and and spirit of our people. He, along with many others here today have been a source of council and guidance this last year. Please welcome Father Naestor, Keeper of the Coeden and the Neorian Path.
## FN’s Speech:
Brothers and sisters of the Neorian Path, and all of Brokvar, I speak to you as a humble servant of our faith, as a keeper of the Coeden. We have seen our land scorched by war, our people scattered like seeds in the wind. But like the Coeden, we endured, rooted in our faith and in the hope of a brighter tomorrow. Today, we are called to decide what kind of nation we wish to become. We stand at a crossroads, where the choices we make will determine not only ***our*** future, but the future of generations yet to come.

For centuries, the Coeden has been a symbol of life, growth, and resilience. It teaches us that from the smallest seed, mighty things can grow. Just as the Coeden has taken root and flourished, so too must we cultivate our nation, tend to its wounds, and nurture its potential. We must protect our heritage, not just the land beneath our feet, but the spirit that binds us together. We must honour the sacrifice of those who have come before us, and in their memory, build a Brokvar that is strong, compassionate, and just.

The Neorian Path calls us to act as stewards of the land and guardians of the spirit. Our faith has been a guiding light through the darkest of times, and now it can help guide us to a new dawn. We must protect what is sacred, and ensure that the new roots of our culture run deep and unshakable. Let us grow together, and may our branches stretch towards the heavens, bearing the fruit of a prosperous and peaceful Brokvar.
## VD introduces CS
Finally, we will hear from a voice not just beyond these shores, but from my homeland, the nation of Sunmaek. He comes not as a stranger, but as a brother, bringing with him the strength and support of a people who understand your struggles and share in your dreams for a brighter future. Osman is here to present a vision of partnership—one born from a bond of kinship and shared purpose. Please welcome Chancellor Sturgis, my esteemed countryman and dear friend, who carries with him the promise of unity between Sunmaek and Brokvar
## CS’s Speech:
Noble & hardy people of Brokvar, I stand before you as a friend from Sunmaek, a nation that has known both war and prosperity. I commend your bravery, your resolve, and your spirit in reclaiming your homeland. It is no small thing to rise from the ashes of occupation and declare yourself a free people once more. But the world beyond Brokvar’s shores is treacherous, and isolation can be perilous. Even now, as you stand on the threshold of a new era, there will be those who would seek to undermine your sovereignty, who would exploit any weakness they find.

I bring an offer of partnership—an alliance that would see Brokvar strong, secure, and prosperous under a banner of shared governance. Our two nations, working together, could achieve much. Sunmaek has long been a land of innovation, of strength, and of stability. With our help, Brokvar could rebuild faster, grow stronger, and secure its place in the world.

This is not an offer of dominance, but of partnership. We do not seek to impose our will or religions upon you, but to stand with you, shoulder to shoulder, as equals. Together, we could forge a new era for your country, an era where the bloodshed of the past is replaced by the harmony of a shared future. Consider this: with the resources of Brokvar and the protection of Sunmaek, you could not only defend against any who would threaten you but thrive in ways previously unimagined. I ask you to see beyond the scars of the past and look to the potential of what we could build together. This is the future I offer—a future of strength, stability, and lasting peace.
