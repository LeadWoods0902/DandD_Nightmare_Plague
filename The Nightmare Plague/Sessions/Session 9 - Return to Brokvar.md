## World State
### Quinn
Gifted a scale by Kaede. taken prisoner by slavers and transported by ship to an unknown country. Taught common by the slavers during the 2 year Journey. During the time on the ship, a neutral passenger who remained hooded at all times would often sneak into the hold to feed and talk to you - given his language, you assume he is from Chimo like you. Other than yourself and Bismuth, there were five other slaves in the hold, all of which were centaurs. Near the end of it's journey, the ship was ambushed by an unknown force, which seemingly killed most of the crew. Other than seeing the inky smoke envelope the captain, you have only the word of the remaining crew (Herouk, Jareth & Seraphina) to go on. Given the dire situation, Herouk forced the other two and some of the slaves into repairing the ship such that it could be sailed to shore. After beaching on the shore, you walked for four days in-land, eventually arriving at the town of Virmarr, where Herouk and the other crew members auctioned the five centaurs off - you luckily were bought by an unknown woman, who paid excessively above the competition for you and Bismuth with richly coloured gemstones.

She took you back to the town's tavern where she met up with her companions, based on appearances, the other three were travellers from another land but had pre-arranged to meet this woman at this tavern. Additionally, there appeared to be another strange woman lined with the group however she was at the time bed bound due to some strange affliction. Later that day, a disoriented and raggedly dressed man stumbles into the tavern, demanding to buy you off of the woman that bought you. The woman introduces herself as Elaine, and apologises for having not introduced herself earlier. She explains that her proprietor was passed information that two individuals of interest may be passing through Virmarr and that she should acquire you under any circumstances - the reasoning behind which she couldn't explain. She did state that her proprietor would be able to remove the magical shackles that bound your wrists, shackles which when put under strain tighten and dig into your flesh as Bismuth found out while trying to force his off. Returning to the new man, he introduces himself as Rolbam and enquires for as to whether this proprietor would be able to help him recover his memory; he explains that other than knowing that he's no longer in Llawyr un Mawr, he knows nothing of how he came to be here or who he was before.

The following morning, the bed bound woman awakens, she seems to have lost most of her memory but introduces herself as Mazikeen, she seems intent on achieving some goal but does not remember what the goal is, Elaine offers to take her to Brokvar, the home of a woman that she believes will be able to help Rolbam with his memory - Mazikeen agrees. Elaine explains that before the party leave, she has business to attend to with the local mayor. She leaves the five of you to explore the town while she meets with him. The five of you, now including the travelling companion of the foreign strangers who introduces herself as Duska head out into the town. The five of you visit a local blacksmith, intent to get your manacles off; Mazikeen seems to have some kind of broken weapon which she wants to have repaired. During your visit to the blacksmith, Rolbam attempts to purchase a caster's focus - the blacksmith explains he does not have anything suitable for casting magic, gesturing at the metal work around him - Rolbam proposes buying a pair of damaged wooden bellows from the man, to which he readily agrees. Additionally, the smith explains to Mazikeen that he does not recognise the material the weapon is made of and under your brother's remarkable persuasion attempts to break the manacles with his chisel - a gift from his grandmother. Unfortunately the chisel shatters, leaving no mark on the manacles - awkwardly and hurriedly, the three of you leave the store.

Departing the store, you witness a scene developing outside of the mayor's house; Elaine has been chased out, expletives and curses being thrown in her direction. Before you can establish why, her and her companions (you and the Duska's companions at the tavern) have been banished from the town. Returning to the tavern to collect Duska's companions: an older, stoic man named Sturgis and his friendly daughter Hinelle, the set of you depart for the northern gates, where Elaine has organise for wagons which you can use to journey to Brokvar. The first day of travel is quick, unbroken and pretty quiet; during the evening, you arrive at the edge of a great forest, less than a mile into the forest, you come across a clearing in which you pitch camp for the night. While sat around the campfire, you notice Hinelle stacking some decorated rocks - you strike up a conversation, learning that the rocks represent a challenge of personal development, she explains that a person is not complete until they can balance the 7 aspects of their self. Unfortunately, before she can finish explaining a low rumbling can be heard nearby... on the other side of the clearing, a set of inconspicuous looking rocks begin to roll towards each other, forming the mass and shape of a squat, bulky creature. 
![[Gravolith_Token.png]]

A fight ensues, in which the five of you throw all of your might at the creature while Elaine maintains a protective field around Sturgis and Hinelle. During the fight, Duska launches a barrage of magic at the creature while its back is turned - striking a large stone-y growth - the creature recoils in pain: Bismuth notices this and bravely launches himself atop the creature, proceeding to hack away at the growth with his axe. Perhaps realising the danger it is in, the creature shakes Bismuth off during which Bismuth loses his grip on his axe, leaving it embedded in the backside of the creature. Faster than should be natural, a storm appears overhead and a great bolt of lightning strikes the creature breaking it into smaller versions of itself - the smaller versions break away from each other and escape into the brush - one of which carrying Bismuth's axe in it's back. Bismuth attempts to chase after the axe but is called back by Elaine who reminds him that he is still manacled and now without his axe, attempting to forge his way through a dense forest he does not know would likely not end well. Begrudgingly, Bismuth re-joins the party.

It quickly became apparent that during the fight, the horses escaped from their stakes and bolted off into the forest; between you, you each take the most essential items from the wagons, leaving a few things behind. Four days of walking northward were required to reach Brokvar, luckily were all equally uneventful - especially compared to the previous night's events. On the second day, you enter a wide gorge through which a river flows - you can see on either side that husks of burnt our buildings line each side - Elaine explains that one upon a time, this valley was lined with mills which processed wheat grown above them on the high rolling hills either side of the gorge - water flowing down into the valley powering the mills before joining together to form the river that traces the bottom of the gorge. As your journey ends, you crest a hill revealing a view of an expansive city set back into a bowl, encased on two sides with a shear mountain face; near the centre of the city, a gigantic tree stands tall, it's bow covering a large portion of a bay underneath it. You note that two large rivers run down the face of the cliff-side, joining the covered bay and leaving through a large river that bends off the to the north a few miles west of the city.

Upon arriving at the gates, the guards recognise Elaine and stand aside to allow entry - the rag-tag and weathered group accompanying her garner an inquisitive stare from the guards both outside and in the city limits. Guiding you through the city, she escorts you through large open spaces, a wide avenue and several narrow alleys before you reach a point from which you can see the tree again in full. Leaning over the bridges of halfway house, the scale of the tree becomes ever more apparent, Elaine explains that the tree is known as the Coeden and has grown from the spot from which the city's patron laid down his life to allow life to prosper in the land: NÃ«oris. Continuing the journey, the path opens up into a large square - much larger than the one you'd previously been in before crossing the bridge. Elain explains that the square is the central hub of business in the city, gesturing to several smiths, an alchemists and a range of other stores and stalls. Eventually, Elaine brings you out onto another avenue, this one much grander and wider than the prior; lined with silvery barked trees with orange leaves, much like the Coeden.

Arriving at a white painted house in the middle of a terrace, Elaine gestures for you to enter: entering, you can see that the inside is all but the same as the outside, dark rich woods, textiles and paints decorating every surface in view. At the end of the room a large square stair case rises out of sight, you can see that a balcony overlooks the room you're stood in, with doors on either side. Elaine guides you up the stair case and faster than would be expected, you arrive at the top floor, a lone door, much heavier and ornate than the many you half-remember passing on the way up; entering, you see the silhouette of a woman, lit solely by flickering fire light sat across the room, a desk stacked high with books, scrolls and strange plant-life between you and her. With a wave of her hand, Elaine bows and leaves while at the same time, candles lining the room illuminate. It becomes apparent that the room is a cross between a study and a botanists workshop: floor to ceiling, every room is lined with all manner of plant life.

Sat behind the heavy desk, the dark haired woman smiles at the 7 of you, gesturing for you to join her at her desk at which a large comfy couch in the middle of the room was facing. After observing you all cross the room, the woman introduces herself as Missy, explaining that she is Elaine's proprietor and has been looking forward to your arrival. Turning first to Rolbam and Mazikeen, she expresses interest, querying as to their origin - them being unexpected yet still welcome guests. Both explain that they have no knowledge of how they came to arrive in Virmarr and that Elaine had told them of her proprietor, a woman with strong magical abilities that could help them recover. Before seating herself fully, she retrieves a plain looking metal rod from a draw in her desk, gesturing for Bismuth and Jasper to approach, touching the rod to the cuffs, they melt away, their mass joining the rod leaving your hands free for the first time in a very long time. Missy notes that Dimeritrium is an extremely powerful extra-terrestrial metal, rare and hard to control with properties that supress the inner magics of the body, adding that she expects the pair of you were unable to use your natural genasi magics while cuffed.

In turn, Missy speaks to you all, speaking in hushed tones, snippets of conversation between herself and her current target can be heard but in general, you know not of what she spoke about with each of your companions. On your turn, she beckoned both you and Bismuth back to her desk, explaining that she'd heard of slavers that would be passing through Virmarr on their way to the capital - she enquired as to why you'd been put on auction there, her intel had confidently stated that you were to be transported to the imperial capital Heinabergsar. You briefly explain that it was a less than ideal situation but gloss over the details, having only just met this mysterious woman. After an eventful week, she offers to let you rest, promising that you would have the opportunity to talk again the following morning. The following morning, Mazikeen awaits you in the corridor outside the room that you and Bismuth had been given to spend the night in. She whispers to you that she has suspicions behind the motives of Elaine & Duska's companions - stating that she overheard them talking of planting a foreign power in charge of the city - mid discussion, Duska exits her room and heads over to you, despite Mazikeen's quick halt to the discussion, it seems Duska overheard the conversation, explaining that she was a guide and companion to Sturgis, who is set to represent the Buyuk of Sunmaek: Emre Aydin in an upcoming of election of state in Brokvar, the first of it's kind in recorded history. Rolbam joins mid conversation, hearing the latter half. Departing the corridor, the five of you follow the open doorways, entering a large dining hall, set for 8; already seated, Sturgis and Hinelle are in deep conversation with Elaine. She explains that Missy apologises for having to leave at such inopportune time but business called and that she would be back within a few days, having left during the night to ride east to meet with a border baron. Continuing on, Elaine queries whether the group would like to browse the city, suggesting a trip to the nearby Esquire Square, the large hub that she had brought the group through the previous night, gesturing to Rolbam and stating that the alchemist on the corner was the one Missy had suggested. Additionally, she indicated that the group could make use of the time to better equip themselves. 

Short on the local currency but nought else to do at the time, the party leave the house, walking down the tree lined avenue, until they reach the wide staircase that would bring them down onto the road connecting to Esquire Square. Entering the square, it becomes apparent that what had seemed like a busy hub the previous evening was but a shadow of the reality, the square was now filled with an even greater number of stalls, people milling between them and coming in and out of shops on all sides of the square. Noting that Rolbam's alchemist is but a short walk along the edge of the square, the group head in that direction, stopping at only one store when Bismuth and Duska wish to enquire about acquiring some new hardware: For Bismuth, a great-axe to replace his recently lost one and for Duska, a new set of armour, having been unable to travel one. Entering the dark smith-store the group find themselves head on with an open forge, dark fumes and heat radiating off of it. In the centre of the room, a woman, dressed in a thick sleeve-less leather apron hammers away at a fine looking pauldron. Apparently taking no notice of the group, Bismuth reaches over and taps her on the shoulder. The woman spins around, half excitedly, half in shock. Exclaiming that she's happy to see customers and that she apologises for not noticing them, noting that she's turned deaf from working the anvil. After some brief to-ing and fro-ing between Bismuth and the smith, it became apparent that her fares were too rich for him, despite her best efforts to explain that her products were the best in the city. After failing to make a sale to Bismuth, the woman seemed ever more intent on securing one through Duska, readily aiming to please while exhibiting the fine armour sets available for sale. Duska, seemingly intent on getting a good deal, proposed to take negotions to
