### 1. Returning to Mistress 
- Malkath is distracted by two kids beating on a third
- He threatens the two kids and then convinces the kid he's a foreign operative and that he should come to him if he ever gets in trouble
- Arriving at Mistress's house, the party find the door blocked by guards. They convince the guards to let them in by proving their residency with letters addressed to them by the mistress of the house.
- Inside they meet Elaine who is surprised to see them inside, criticising the resolve of the guards. She explains that Mistress is in a meeting with the commander of the guard: Niahl.
- After some waiting in the foyer, Niahl comes down the stairs and briefly speaks in hushed tones with Elaine. While leaving, he visibly reacts to Malkath but quickly corrects his composure.
- Finally allowed to go upstairs, the party head straight to Mistress' office - unaware of the fact that she was still in a meeting with other guests. Bismuth barges in, to which Mistress exasperatingly berates him, stating that there will be time to talk in the evening. Since they are there however, mistress explains that she's heard of their work on the farm and is impressed. She introduces her guests: Owain and Ceinwen Moss - Owain is here to run in the election. Mistress invites them to the divide later in the day to hear out the first round of candidates give their speeches.
- Leaving, the group leave for Jarae's intent on finding a cure for Jasper's arm and to tell her the good news concerning the farm job.
