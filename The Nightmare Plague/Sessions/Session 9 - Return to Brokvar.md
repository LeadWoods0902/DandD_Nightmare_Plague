### Quinn
Gifted a scale by Kaede. taken prisoner by slavers and transported by ship to an unknown country. Taught common by the slavers during the 2 year Journey. During the time on the ship, a neutral passenger who remained hooded at all times would often sneak into the hold to feed and talk to you - given his language, you assume he is from Chimo like you. Other than yourself and Bismuth, there were five other slaves in the hold, all of which were centaurs. Near the end of it's journey, the ship was ambushed by an unknown force, which seemingly killed most of the crew. Other than seeing the inky smoke envelope the captain, you have only the word of the remaining crew (Herouk, Jareth & Seraphina) to go on. Given the dire situation, Herouk forced the other two and some of the slaves into repairing the ship such that it could be sailed to shore. After beaching on the shore, you walked for four days in-land, eventually arriving at the town of Virmarr, where Herouk and the other crew members auctioned the five centaurs off - you luckily were bought by an unknown woman, who paid excessively above the competition for you and Bismuth with richly coloured gemstones.

She took you back to the town's tavern where she met up with her companions, based on appearances, the other three were travellers from another land but had pre-arranged to meet this woman at this tavern. Additionally, there appeared to be another strange woman lined with the group however she was at the time bed bound due to some strange affliction. Later that day, a disoriented and raggedly dressed man stumbles into the tavern, demanding to buy you off of the woman that bought you. The woman introduces herself as Elaine, and apologises for having not introduced herself earlier. She explains that her proprietor was passed information that two individuals of interest may be passing through Virmarr and that she should acquire you under any circumstances - the reasoning behind which she couldn't explain. She did state that her proprietor would be able to remove the magical shackles that bound your wrists, shackles which when put under strain tighten and dig into your flesh as Bismuth found out while trying to force his off. Returning to the new man, he introduces himself as Rolbam and enquires for as to whether this proprietor would be able to help him recover his memory; he explains that other than knowing that he's no longer in Llawyr un Mawr, he knows nothing of how he came to be here or who he was before.

The following morning, the bed bound woman awakens, she seems to have lost most of her memory but introduces herself as Mazikeen, she seems intent on achieving some goal but does not remember what the goal is, Elaine offers to take her to Brokvar, the home of a woman that she believes will be able to help Rolbam with his memory - Mazikeen agrees. Elaine explains that before the party leave, she has business to attend to with the local mayor. She leaves the five of you to explore the town while she meets with him. The five of you, now including the travelling companion of the foreign strangers who introduces herself as Duska head out into the town. The five of you visit a local blacksmith, intent to get your manacles off; Mazikeen seems to have some kind of broken weapon which she wants to have repaired. During your visit to the blacksmith, Rolbam attempts to purchase a caster's focus - the blacksmith explains he does not have anything suitable for casting magic, gesturing at the metal work around him - Rolbam proposes buying a pair of damaged wooden bellows from the man, to which he readily agrees. Additionally, the smith explains to Mazikeen that he does not recognise the material the weapon is made of and under your brother's remarkable persuasion attempts to break the manacles with his chisel - a gift from his grandmother. Unfortunately the chisel shatters, leaving no mark on the manacles - awkwardly and hurriedly, the three of you leave the store.

Departing the store, you witness a scene developing outside of the mayor's house; Elaine has been chased out, expletives and curses being thrown in her direction. Before you can establish why, her and her companions (you and the Duska's companions at the tavern) have been banished from the town. Returning to the tavern to collect Duska's companions: an older, stoic man named Sturgis and his friendly daughter Hinelle, the set of you depart for the northern gates, where Elaine has organise for wagons which you can use to journey to Brokvar. The first day of travel is quick, unbroken and pretty quiet; during the evening, you arrive at the edge of a great forest, less than a mi
