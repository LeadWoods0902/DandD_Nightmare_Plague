Gifted a scale by Kaede. taken prisoner by slavers and transported by ship to an unknown country. Taught common by the slavers during the 2 year Journey. During the time on the ship, a neutral passenger who remained hooded at all times would often sneak into the hold to feed and talk to you - given his language, you assume he is from Chimo like you.
