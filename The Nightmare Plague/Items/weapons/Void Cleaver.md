A curved sword once wielded by Napella Lundgren - after her death, the weapon passed to Ven-Dryk, who has since wielded it in the war against the empire.

Once after a long rest, the sword bestows upon its wielder the ability to bend reality, allowing them to step into the void and emerge elsewhere (granting one use of the Dimension Door spell).

Furthermore, this weapon possesses three charges that replenish with each long rest. These charges may be expended for the following effects:
- Void Tear: Upon a successful attack with this weapon, deal an extra 3d6 force damage.
- Void Displacement: Upon a successful attack with this weapon, you can teleport the target creature anywhere within sight and within 30 feet.
