A curved sword once wielded by Napella Lundgren - after her death, the weapon passed to Ven-Dryk, who has since wielded it in the war against the empire.

Once per long rest, the sword grants the user to fold reality, stepping into the void and re-appearing else where (grants one use of Dimension Door)

Additionally, this weapon has three charges which refill on a long rest, these charges may be spent on the following actions:
- Void Tear: On a successful attack with this weapon, deal an additional 3d6 force damage
- Void Displacement: On a successful attack with this weapon, you can teleport the target creature anywhere within sight and within 30ft
