A pair of curved swords wielded by Ven-Dryk.

**Pocket Dimension:**
When not in use, the Void Cleavers rest within a pocket dimension accessible only to their attuned wielder. If dropped or lost, the blades return to this dimension, ensuring they remains within the grasp of their master.

**Void Charges:**
Once per long rest, the swords bestow upon their wielder the ability to bend reality, allowing them to step into the void and emerge elsewhere using the Dimension Door spell.

The blade possesses three charges, which can be expended after successfully striking a creature with an attack. Upon expending a charge, the wielder can choose one of the following effects:
- **Void Tear:** The blade resonates with an otherworldly force, dealing an additional 3d6 force damage to the target.
- **Void Displacement:** The wielder harnesses the weapon's interdimensional properties to banish the struck creature to a visible location within 30 feet of the wielder. The creature must be Medium size or smaller to be affected by this ability.
