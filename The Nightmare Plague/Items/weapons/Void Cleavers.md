A pair of curved swords wielded by Ven-Dryk.



**Pocket Dimension:**
When not in use, the Blade of Dimensional Conquest rests within a pocket dimension accessible only to its attuned wielder. If dropped or lost, the blade will return to this dimension, ensuring it remains within the grasp of its chosen master.

**Void Charges**
Once per long rest, the swords bestow upon their wielder the ability to bend reality, allowing them to step into the void and emerge elsewhere using the Dimension Door spell.

The blade possesses three charges, which can be expended after successfully striking a creature with an attack. Upon expending a charge, the wielder can choose one of the following effects:
- **Void Tear:** The blade resonates with an otherworldly force, dealing an additional 3d6 force damage to the target.
- **Void Displacement:** The wielder harnesses the weapon's interdimensional properties to banish the struck creature to a visible location within 30 feet of the wielder. The creature must be Medium size or smaller to be affected by this ability.
