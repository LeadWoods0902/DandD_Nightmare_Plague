A pair of curved swords wielded by Ven-Dryk.

When not in use, the weapons rest within a pocket dimension, retrievable by only the user. When dropped or lost, the weapons return to this dimension

Once per long rest, the swords bestow upon their wielder the ability to bend reality, allowing them to step into the void and emerge elsewhere (granting one use of the Dimension Door spell).

The blade possesses three charges, which can be expended after successfully striking a creature with an attack. Upon expending a charge, the wielder can choose one of the following effects:
- **Void Tear:** The blade resonates with an otherworldly force, dealing an additional 3d6 force damage to the target.
- **Void Displacement:** The wielder harnesses the weapon's interdimensional properties to banish the struck creature to a visible location within 30 feet of the wielder. The creature must be Medium size or smaller to be affected by this ability.
