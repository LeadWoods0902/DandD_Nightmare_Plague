The trident gleams with an otherworldly sheen, its once-broken black metal now mended with a shimmering layer of crystalline ice that never melts, even in the fiercest heat. Intricate frost patterns spider-web across its surface, radiating from the base to the sharp, deadly prongs. These prongs glisten as if perpetually coated in fresh frost, the cold air around them crackling faintly. 

Touching the trident sends a biting chill through the fingers, a reminder of the frigid power contained within. Whenever the trident is wielded, the temperature drops noticeably, the air around it growing colder as the weapon draws in heat like a winter storm. Those nearby can see their breath misting in the air, and a thin layer of frost forms on the ground with each swing.

### Frozen Fury
The trident deals 1d8 piercing + 1d6 cold damage.
### Winter's call
The wielder can cast Cone of Cold using the trident once per day. This recharge happens at dawn in cold environments, or when the trident is submerged in cold water for an hour.
### Frostbite
Upon a critical hit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) or be stunned for one round as frost covers their body.
### Piercing Ice Prison
The wielder can attempt to impale a target with the trident, freezing them solid in place. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 16) or be restrained in a block of ice. While frozen, they are paralyzed and take 2d6 cold damage at the start of each of their turns.
- **Limitation**: The trident remains embedded in the target, and the wielder loses use of the weapon until it is manually retrieved. The ice prison effect lasts as long as the trident remains impaled in the enemy, or until the target successfully breaks free with a successful Strength saving throw at the end of each of their turns.
