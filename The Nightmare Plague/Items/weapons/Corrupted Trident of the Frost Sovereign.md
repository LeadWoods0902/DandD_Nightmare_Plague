![[Trident.png]]

---
The trident lies in pieces, its once-pristine black metal fractured and broken, with jagged shards suspended unnaturally in mid-air. Dark, wispy tendrils of necrotic energy coil tightly around the shards, binding them together in a sinister embrace. These tendrils pulse with an unsettling rhythm, like the slow beat of a dying heart, stretching out toward any nearby life. The metal itself seems to resist the connection, yet the dark magic clings to it, holding the fragments in place with an almost desperate hunger.

A faint, oppressive chill accompanies the trident, and a low, barely audible whispering follows itâ€”half-formed words in an unknown language that leave a sense of dread in their wake. These whispers escalate into pained, distant wails when the weapon strikes, filling the minds of those struck with visions of past victims, their faces twisted in agony. The screams fade only after the weapon is removed, leaving an eerie silence.

### Necrotic Strike
The trident deals 1d8 piercing + 1d6 necrotic damage.
### Sapping Impalement
The wielder can cast Vampiric Touch using the trident once per day. This recharge happens at midnight, or if the trident is used to kill someone.
### Exhausting Siphon
Upon a critical hit, the target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15) or gain a level of exhaustion.
### Piercing Soul Anchor
The wielder can impale a target with the trident, binding their soul to the weapon. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 16) or become anchored to the trident. While anchored, they are paralyzed and lose 1d6 hit points at the start of each of their turns as necrotic energy siphons their life force.
- **Soul Drain**: For every 10 hit points drained from the target, the trident's wielder gains a temporary +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage for the next 10 minutes (up to +3).
- **Limitation**: The trident remains embedded in the target, and the wielder cannot use it until it is manually retrieved. However, the weapon siphons necrotic energy until the target dies or the wielder removes the trident, if another creature attempts to remove the trident, it must succeed a strength check DC 15 or become paralyzed additionally.
