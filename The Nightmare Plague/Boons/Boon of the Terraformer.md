*E* represents the number of Essence spent
## Level 1 - Terra Affinity (Passive)
The Genasi gains enhanced mobility on terrain made of earth or stone, granting an additional 10ft of movement
Additionally, they can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone without incurring disadvantage

The Genasi can manipulate earth within a range of 30ft, allowing them to mold the earth around them to their will so long as there is a physical connection between them and the earth being controlled, up to a maximum volume of 5 cubic feet

## Level 2 - Terra Morph (1 Essence)
The Genasi gains the ability to contort and transform the ground around them into rough, uneven terrain.

As an action, the Genasi can create difficult terrain:
- **within a 15-foot radius circle centred on yourself**
- Alternatively, **within a column measuring 15 by 45-foot**

## Level 3 - Terra Quake (min 2 Essence)
The Genasi can unleash a shockwave into the ground, creating a devastating ripple in the ground in front of them.

As an action, the Genasi can expend at least 2 Genasi Essence to summon a "Terra Quake." This ability creates a massive shockwave in a 30-foot cone or a 15ft circle centred on the Genasi. Grounded creatures within the cone must make a Strength saving throw or be carried 30 feet away, taking 2d6 Bludgeoning + Ed4 force damage based

## Level 4 - Stone Forged (3 Essence)
The Genasi's mastery over earth deepens, providing them with a defensive ability forged from the very stones beneath their feet.

As an action, the Genasi can expend 3 Genasi Essence to activate "Stone Forged." In this state, the Genasi temporarily enhances their resilience by merging with the surrounding earth and stone. This ability grants them the following benefits:
- **Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing Damage**
- **Immovable Stance**: The Genasi gains advantage on Strength saving throws and checks to resist being moved or knocked prone

## Level 5 - Earthen Fortitude (4 Essence)
The Genasi's connection to the ground grants them enhanced fortitude.

As a reaction, the Genasi can resist a source of damage that would normally incapacitate the Genasi. They endure the damage without falling unconscious or being incapacitated.
