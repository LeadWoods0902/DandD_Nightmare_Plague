## Level 1 - Arctic Affinity (0 Essence/ Passive)
## Level 2 - Arctic Infusion (1 Essence)
Infuse weapons with ice damage, chance of leaving targets frostbitten (damage on next hit & half movement speed for 2 rounds)
## Level 3 - Arctic Flurry (2 Essence)
Circular 20ft AoE centred on Genasi that halves the movement of targets inside and gives them weakness to fire and physical attacks
## Level 4 - Frost Forged Armour (3 Essence)

The Genasi taps into the resilience of ice and snow, creating a protective layer of Frost Forged Armour.

As a bonus action, the Genasi can expend 3 Essence to envelop themselves in an icy sheen. This Frostforged Armor grants temporary hit points and resistance to cold and physical damage for a duration of 1 minute. Additionally, enemies that strike the Genasi in melee have a chance to become frostbitten, reducing their attack speed for a short duration.
## Level 5 - Cryogenic Overdrive (4 Essence)
The Genasi taps into the power of Cryogenic Celerity, cooling themselves to the point of heightened efficiency. This ability grants increased speed, improved reaction times, and enhanced agility, allowing the Genasi to manoeuvre with unparalleled quickness on the battlefield.
