## Level 1 - Arctic Affinity (0 Essence/ Passive)
## Level 2 - Arctic Infusion (1 Essence)
Infuse weapons with ice damage, chance of leaving targets frostbitten (damage on next hit & half movement speed for 2 rounds)
## Level 3 - Arctic Flurry (2 Essence)
Circular 20ft AoE centred on Genasi that halves the movement of targets inside and gives them weakness to fire and physical attacks
## Level 4 - Frost Forged (3 Essence)

The Genasi taps into the resilience of ice and snow, creating a protective layer of Frostforged Armor.

As a bonus action, the Genasi can expend 3 Essence to envelop themselves in an icy sheen. This Frostforged Armor grants temporary hit points and resistance to cold and physical damage for a duration of 1 minute. Additionally, enemies that strike the Genasi in melee have a chance to become frostbitten, reducing their attack speed for a short duration.
## Level 5 -
