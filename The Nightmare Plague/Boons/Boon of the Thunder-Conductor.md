*E* represents the number of Essence spent
## Level 1 -  Thunder Affinity (Passive)
The Genasi gains enhanced mobility while moving in adverse weather conditions (heavy rain, storms),  gaining an additional 10ft of movement
Additionally, the Genasi's affinity with lightning grants them advantage on saving throws to resist lightning and thunder damage

The Genasi can manipulate electrical energy within a range of 30ft, enabling them to redirect and disperse energy. Additionally, the Genasi's melee strikes become electrically charged dealing 1d4 lightning damage
## Level 2 - Thunder Bolt (1 Essence)

## Level 3 - Thunder Wave (min 1 Essence)

## Level 4 - Arcing Volt (min 2 Essence)
The Genasi gains the ability to shoot out a fine electrical beam that arcs to nearby targets.

As an action, the Genasi can target E-1 creatures within 60 feet with an "Arcing Volt," dealing ((30+10(E-2))10)d8 electrical damage. The attack chains to each target within 30+10(Eâˆ’2) feet of the first. Each subsequent target must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid conducting the arcing volt.
 - **Failed Throw**: the target takes ((30+10(E-2))//10-x)d8 lightning damage where x increases by 1 for every 10 feet from the first target. The arc bounces to another target
 - **Saved Throw**: the target dodges the arc, ending it's path
