*E* refers to the number of Essence required or spent
## Level 1 - Aquatic Affinity (Passive)
The Genasi gains enhanced mobility in water, allowing them to swim at an increased speed. 
Additionally, they can breathe underwater, giving them an advantage in aquatic environments

The Genasi can manipulate water within a certain range, allowing them to part or move bodies of water and shape them into simple forms. Up to a maximum volume of 10L * \[PROF\]

## Level 2 - Aquatic Mend (min 1 E)
When submerged in water, the Genasi can draw upon the healing properties of water to regenerate health.

As an action, the Genasi can recover their own health or the health of a target within 15ft, see the table below.

| Character Level | Health Regenerated | 1 Essence | 2 Essence | 3 Essence |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 1d4 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 2 - 5 | 3 - 6 | 4 - 7 |
| 2 | 2d4 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 3 - 9 | 4 - 10 | 5 - 11 |
| 5 | 2d6 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 3 - 13 | 4 - 14 | 5 - 15 |
| 7 | 3d6 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 4 - 19 | 5 - 20 | 6 - 21 |
| 10 | 3d8 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 4 - 25 | 5 - 26 | 6 - 27 |

| 20 | 4d10 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 5 - 41 | 6 - 42 | 7 - 43 |

## Level 3 - Aqua Jet (min 2 Essence)
The Genasi can shoot a concentrated jet of water as a ranged attack.

As an action, the Genasi can focus their essence to unleash a "Hydro Jet", propelling a forceful stream of water toward a target. The attack inflicts damage and exerts a formidable push, potentially toppling adversaries.
- **Force Damage**: The Hydro Jet inflicts Ed6 force damage
- **Knockback**: Additionally, the force of the Hydro Jet initiates a knockback effect. The target must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + Genasi's proficiency bonus + Genasi's Constitution modifier).
	- On a failed saving throw, the target is pushed back up to 15ft. If they collide with a solid object, they take an additional Ed4 force damage
	- On a successful saving throw, the target withstands the force, avoiding being knocked back


## Level 4 - Aqua Veil (2 Essence)
The Genasi learns to manipulate water defensively, creating a protective barrier.

As an action, expend 2 Essence to invoke an "Aqua Veil". This ability envelops the Genasi in a shimmering watery barrier, providing additional protection in the following ways:
- **Temporary Hit Points**: The Aqua Veil bestows temporary hit points equal to the Genasi's current character level plus their \[PROF\] modifier. 
- **Damage Resistance**: The veil offers resistance against ranged attacks, reducing the inflicted damage by 50%.
- **Fire Immunity**: While the temporary hit points persist, the Genasi gains immunity to fire damage.

Additionally, when a target within 10 feet of the Genasi, the Genasi can, as a bonus action, expend up to 1 Essence to cast "Aquatic Healing" on that target. 

## Level 5 - Aqua Lash (1 E)
Drawing upon their innate connection to water, the Genasi can summon a whip made of liquid currents, extending seamlessly from their arm.

As an action, the Genasi can create an Aqua Lash with a reach of 15 feet. The water whip is a finesse melee weapon, and the Genasi can make a melee spell attack against a target within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + Genasi's proficiency bonus + Genasi's Constitution modifier).
- If the target fails the saving throw, they are restrained by the water whip until the start of the Genasi's next turn

On the Genasi's next turn, as a bonus action, they can attempt to pull the restrained target towards them. The target must make another Strength saving throw (DC as before).
- If the target fails, they are pulled towards the Genasi in a straight line and knocked prone, taking an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage upon landing.
- If the target succeeds, they are released from the restraint.
