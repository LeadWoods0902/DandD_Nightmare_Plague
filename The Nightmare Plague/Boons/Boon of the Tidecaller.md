## Level 1 (0 E/ Passive)
The Genasi gains enhanced mobility in water, allowing them to swim at an increased speed. 
Additionally, they can breathe underwater, giving them an advantage in aquatic environments

The Genasi can manipulate water within a certain range, allowing them to part bodies of water, create barriers, or shape water into simple forms.

## Level 2 - Aquatic Healing (min 1 E)
When submerged in water, the Genasi can draw upon the healing properties of water to regenerate health.

As an action, the Genasi can recover their own health or the health of a target within 15ft, see the table below.

| Character Level | Health Regenerated | 1 Essence | 2 Essence | 3 Essence |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 1d4 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 2 - 5 | 3 - 6 | 4 - 7 |
| 2 | 2d4 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 3 - 9 | 4 - 10 | 5 - 11 |
| 5 | 2d6 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 3 - 13 | 4 - 14 | 5 - 15 |

## Level 3 - Hydro Jet (min 2 Essence)
The Genasi can shoot a concentrated jet of water as a ranged attack.

As an action, the Genasi can focus their essence to unleash a Hydro Jet, propelling a forceful stream of water toward a target. The attack inflicts damage and exerts a formidable push, potentially toppling adversaries.
- Force Damage: The Hydro Jet inflicts Ed6 force damage
- Knockback: 


## Level 4 - Aqua Veil (2 E)
The Genasi learns to manipulate water defensively, creating a protective barrier.

As an action, expend 2E to cast "Aqua Veil." This ability surrounds the Genasi with a watery veil, granting them temporary hit points equal to their level plus their \[PROF\] modifier. The veil provides resistance to ranged damage and immunity to fire damage until the temporary hit points are depleted.

When a target is within 10ft of the Genasi, the Genasi can spend a bonus action to cast Aquatic Healing on the target. 

## Level 5 - Aqua Lash (1 E)
Drawing upon their innate connection to water, the Genasi can summon a whip made of liquid currents, extending seamlessly from their arm.

As an action, the Genasi can create an Aqua Lash with a reach of 15 feet. The water whip is a finesse melee weapon, and the Genasi can make a melee spell attack against a target within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + Genasi's proficiency bonus + Genasi's Constitution modifier).
- If the target fails the saving throw, they are restrained by the water whip until the start of the Genasi's next turn

On the Genasi's next turn, as a bonus action, they can attempt to pull the restrained target towards them. The target must make another Strength saving throw (DC as before).
- If the target fails, they are pulled towards the Genasi in a straight line and knocked prone, taking an additional 1d8 bludgeoning damage upon landing.
- If the target succeeds, they are released from the restraint.
