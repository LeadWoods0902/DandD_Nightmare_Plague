## Level 1 (0 E/ Passive)
The Genasi gains enhanced mobility in water, allowing them to swim at an increased speed. 
Additionally, they can breathe underwater, giving them an advantage in aquatic environments

The Genasi can manipulate water within a certain range, allowing them to part bodies of water, create barriers, or shape water into simple forms.

## Level 2 - Aquatic Healing (min 1 E)
When submerged in water, the Genasi can draw upon the healing properties of water to regenerate their own health.

| Character Level | Health Regenerated | 1 Essence | 2 Essence | 3 Essence |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 1d4 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 2 - 5 | 3 - 6 | 4 - 7 |
| 2 | 2d4 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 3 - 9 | 4 - 10 | 5 - 11 |
| 5 | 2d6 + (E * max(\[CON\], 1)) | 3 - 13 | 4 - 14 | 5 - 15 |

## Level 3 - Hydro Jet (min 2 E)
The Genasi can shoot a concentrated jet of water as a ranged attack. This attack deals damage and pushes an enemy back. On a failed strength save, the enemy is knocked prone

General Formula:
Force Damage = Ed6+\[PROF\]
Knockback = 5 + 5(E-2)


## Level 4 - Aqua Veil (2 E)
The Genasi learns to manipulate water defensively, creating a protective barrier.

As an action, expend 2E to cast "Aqua Veil." This ability surrounds the Genasi with a watery veil, granting them temporary hit points equal to their level plus their \[SPELL\] modifier. The veil provides resistance to ranged damage and immunity to fire damage until the temporary hit points are depleted.

## *Level 5 - Aquaform (1 Essence)*
*The Genasi achieves a deeper understanding of their aquatic heritage, gaining further control over their form and the surrounding water.*

*As a bonus action, the Genasi can transform their body into a fluid state, allowing them to move through tight spaces and making them resistant to physical damage until the start of their next turn.*
