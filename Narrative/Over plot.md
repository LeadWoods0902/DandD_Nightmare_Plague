[[Nomli Gurglegum]], a privateer by profession is returning from a long journey from the east. While on route, Nomli and his crew (played by the party) are ambushed by pirates and a mysterious flying creature (masked by fog). The mast of the sister ship is snapped by the creature during combat. Nomli loses his arm arm and is thrown into the sea. The pirates take the grand ship and leave the sister ship stranded. Helmed by Nomli's second Lieutenant [[Herouk Barrelbasher]], the sister ship is forced ashore by the tide; crashing in the bay below Brokvar's high ridge.

Other PC origins

Herouk brings the crew and cargo to [[Port Town]], with the intention of selling it all off, repairing his ship and retiring. Herouk is successful in selling off all of the boxed cargo and then attempts to sell the slaves. There is little interest initially, until a stranger approaches and offers an exorbitant amount of money for the slaves. There is a lot of muttering but no one raises a higher bid. The auction ends promptly and everyone disperses quickly. Herouk and the buyer make the exchange and the slaves are escorted to Riverbend.



On the road to Brokvar, they are saved from a fight they cannot possibly win by a man named [[Gabriel]], Gabriel believes that the Queen of Brokvar is an impostor and wants to investigate further. It transpires that this is indeed the case but also that the unknown group supporting the fake queen are getting funding and support from the Empire. Gabriel reveals that it was most likely the Empire that first took the Genasi twins from their homeland. Unfortunately there is nothing they can do to dethrone the Queen, killing her or otherwise dealing with her would start a war or at the least lead to their execution. Allies would be required as would the removal of the empire from the throne. ***Some point some time scrap with [[Rune Warriors]].***
