## Story

The scene is set by a monologuing first mate Herouk Barrelbasher, a summer dwarf fond of poetry. In time with the wind dropping, the waves die down and the water surrounding the ship begins to vibrate at an ever increasing level. Suddenly the vibrations stop and everything is silent. Broken only by the scream of the lookout as he tumbles from his perch. Stood atop the masthead is a figure of epic proportions but no sooner had they been seen, they dissapeared in a puff of dense smoke that descends upon the deck of The Kilfenora and The Melodious Linnet like ink suspended in water. 

As the smoke fills the area around the ships, a slowly increasing sound can be heard filling the air. 

Crescendoing, increasing in pitch and fortitude. whine, squeal, persistent. 

The sound cuts to a sudden stop and a formless black shape snaps through the smoke cloud and the creaking of timbers can be heard. With a sudden crash the main mast of both ships crash down into the waters around the ships. The scene cuts to Nomli, captain of the Kilfenora emerging from his cabin - cutlasses in hand, dressed from head to toe in epic atire. With a moralle raising battle cry, combat begins as pirates board the two ships.
