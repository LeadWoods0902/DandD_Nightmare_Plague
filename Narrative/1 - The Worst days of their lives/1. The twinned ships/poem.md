Oh, Captain, my dear friend so true,
As we sail the ocean's vast blue,
Amidst these waves, my heart feels torn,
Memories of mahogany, forlorn.

I long for sweet wine's tender caress,
And home's warmth, a cherished address.
Yearning for rest in this endless chase,
As we traverse this boundless space.

Together we face the vast unknown,
Seeking solace in the land we've known.
Captain, my friend, by your side I'll stay,
Until we reach the shores of islet de mercay.
