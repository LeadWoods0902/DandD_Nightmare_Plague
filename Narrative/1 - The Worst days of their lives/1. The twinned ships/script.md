Two ships sail upon tranquil water, embraced only by a gentle breeze - the sun shines brightly overhead, casting its warm rays upon the tanned crew as they navigate the ship with skilful precision. With not a cloud in sight, the ship glides effortlessly over the smooth un-tampered waters, leaving a trail of ripples in its wake - the only sign of their existence in thsi vast open space. The silence broken only by:

Deckhand: 
	Three years we've been away! This last voyage alone has taken 4 months and what do we have to show for it? A box of scraps and some pets for the empress!? Aye, it'll pay well that's for sure but not a penny of which we'll see - mark me brothers, once this ship docks I'm making straight for the border and leaving the country - it was fucked when we left, it'll be a damn sight worse when we return.

Herouk:
	Aye, it's been a long old slog but relax my friend - land should only be a day away and while it be a troubled peace, it was a peace both sides agreed to.

As Herouk finishes his sentenace, the deckhand feels a numbing warm wash over hi, sighing from a combination of sudden powerful emotions he heads back to his station beckoning his comrades to join him. Herouk smiles to himself, gladdended by the fact that despite the many years at sea, he had not lost his learned ways. 

The Melodius Linnet was a fine ship, perfectly fast and sturdy to boot but unmatched  grace by its sister ship the Kilfenora. Herouk was a fast learner but still unacustomed to the art of Captaincy, it was only after the untimely death of the Linnet's former Captain, that Nomli (the captain of the Kilfenora and Leader of this duologous convoy) had risen him to a position of leadership. 

Before entering the cabin, Nomli noted the sudden drop in the wind but thought nothing more of it than that the wind had simpl shifted.

Elsewhere in this same moment in time, a comet streaks over head. crashing down into a forest not far south from places civilised.

Herouk palms a smooth stone in his hand, paired with one in the posession of Nomli, the two can talk in private via telepathic message:

Herouk:
	Nomli, we need to talk about what's going to happen when we reach land - you know how I feel about transporting this kind of carg...

With a crack like a whip, a thunder clap breaks the silence - rushing outside, what not a minute ago had been a calm serene sea was suddenly a dark abyss of swirling chaos. Mirroring the sky, turned evil by something lurking in the rapidly rolling fog. Herouk jumps atop the port side railing - clinging to a hanging line for support:

Herouk:
	Avast me crew, ready yourselves, draw weapons and fight like you did in Sombahal - something unnaturals a'comin and it won't back down easy!

Drawing his twinned cutlasses, Herouk glances towards the Kilfenora - in a similar position to himself stood the wonderful and marvelous Nomli Gurglegum - a dwarf like himself but preened to a level that even the richest of land-settlers could not attain: Nomli always assumed some degree of magic was involved in maintaining his appearance.
