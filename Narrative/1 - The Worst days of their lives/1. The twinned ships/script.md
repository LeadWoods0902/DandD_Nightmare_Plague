Deckhand: 
	Three years we've been away! This last voyage alone has taken 4 months and what do we have to show for it? A box of scraps and some pets for the empress!? Aye, it'll pay well that's for sure but not a penny of which we'll see - mark me brothers, once this ship docks I'm making straight for the border and leaving the country - it was fucked when we left, it'll be a damn sight worse when we return.

Herouk:
	Aye, it's been a long old slog but relax my friend - land should only be a day away and while it a troubled peace, it was peace. have I ever let you down?
