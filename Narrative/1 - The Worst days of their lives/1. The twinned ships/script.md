Two ships sail upon tranquil water, embraced only by a gentle breeze - the sun shines brightly overhead, casting its warm rays upon the tanned crew as they navigate the ship with skilful precision. With not a cloud in sight, the ship glides effortlessly over the smooth un-tampered waters, leaving a trail of ripples in its wake.

Deckhand: 
	Three years we've been away! This last voyage alone has taken 4 months and what do we have to show for it? A box of scraps and some pets for the empress!? Aye, it'll pay well that's for sure but not a penny of which we'll see - mark me brothers, once this ship docks I'm making straight for the border and leaving the country - it was fucked when we left, it'll be a damn sight worse when we return.

Herouk:
	Aye, it's been a long old slog but relax my friend - land should only be a day away and while it be a troubled peace, it was a peace both sides agreed to.

Herouk begins to make his way to his cabin to use the sending stone within to talk with the captain of the ships's sister-ship. The Melodius Linnet was a fine ship, perfectly fast and sturdy to boot but unmatched was it by the grace with which the Kilfenora held. Herouk was unacustomed to the art of Captaincy, it was only after the untimely death of the Linnet's former Captain, that Nomli (the captain of the Kilfenora and Leader of this duologous convoy) had risen him to a position of leadership. 

Before entering the cabin, Nomli noted the sudden drop in the wind but thought nothing more of it than that the wind had simpl shifted.

Elsewhere in this same moment in time, a comet streaks over head. crashing down into a forest not far south from places civilised.

Herouk:
	Nomli, we need to talk about what's going to happen when we reach land - you know how I feel about transporting this kind of carg...

With a crack like a whip, a thunder clap
