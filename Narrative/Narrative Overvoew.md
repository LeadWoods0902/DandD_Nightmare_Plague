# Session 1

#### The Twinned Ships
A pair of ships, north east of [[Brokvar]] are heading for the capital [[Heinabergsar]] but are set upon by pirates, leaving the crew of the surviving ship in a skeleton state and without a captain as [[Nomli Gurglegum]] (The captain of both ships) is slain during the combat that ensues.

#
Cutting to [[Virmarr]], we are introduced to [[Duska Von Mori]], a librarian of [[Sunmaek]]. Accompanied by [[Chancellor Sturgis]] and his daughter [[Hinelle]], the trio are waiting upon the arrival of a contact from the city of [[Brokvar]] who is set to guide them the rest of the way to the city. The contact, [[Elaine]], is set to arrive in three days time.
