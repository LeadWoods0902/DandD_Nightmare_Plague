Pick up Bismuth & Jasper from Port Town
- Elaine sent by the Mistress to acquire "two lost souls, fresh off the sea"
- Take them to Virmarr, as Elaine is also to meet the Chancellor their and escort him to Brokvar
- Enroute:
	- Pass through Riverbend
	- Stopped on the road by a traveller, urging them **not** to go to hillockton, some made Sorceror has locked himself in his lab (emanating smoke, lights and sound) and that almost certainly means trouble
- Cut to Mazikeen in the forest, waking up and finding herself alone, clutching the shards of a broken Trident. Beside her is the husk of what was probably once a human, Aime however has no memory of the event nor any event prior to awakening. She stumbles towards the shore, finds a boat and rows across the sea towards the far shore.
- Once in Virmarr, looking for the Chancellor in the tavern.
	- Everyone splits up to look around
		- Get into some small scenarios
	- Either Jasper or Bismuth will find the Chancellor, who is seated with his daughter Hinelle and Duska, their Cleric. 
- The party stays the night in Virmarr.
- Cut to one of Alfread's decendents
	- Introduce Tom as this character
	- go through the motions
- Cut back to the present day, force a party member into a haggling scenario. 
- Mazikeen stumbles into them, causing a massive scene
- Elaine uses a calming magic on Mazikeen
	- Once Mazikeen has calimed down, talks with them
	- Mazikeen will now be joining the party and returning to Brokvar.
- Leave for Brokvar
- Enroute, you spot smoke coming from over the hills towards Hillockton
	- Elaine pushes the party not to, remining them of what the traveller had said the previous day
	- If the party aren't inclined to investigate, then a clear and shrill scream will come from the village "Hellllp!"
- Upon arriving, there is a medium sized building that has had its middle removed (terminator bubble style). Lying on the ground is a strange naked man. Who seemingly is older than should be reasonable for somone at the epicentre of such a strange event. Elaine thanks the party and offers the strange man a hand and some clothes, which she procures from within the folds of her dress. 

- The party is then forced to vote on whether to brave edging the shores of the Barrier Lake or make the gruelling crawl through the tunnels that carve through the southern range
