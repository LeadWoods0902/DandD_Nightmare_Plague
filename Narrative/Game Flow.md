Pick up Bismuth & Jasper from Port Town
- Elaine sent by the Mistress to acquire "two lost souls, fresh off the sea"
- Take them to Virmarr, as Elaine is also to meet the Chancellor their and escort him to Brokvar
- En route:
	- Pass through Riverbend
	- Stopped on the road by a traveller, urging them **not** to go to hillockton, some made Sorceror has locked himself in his lab (emanating smoke, lights and sound) and that almost certainly means trouble
- Cut to Mazikeen in the forest, waking up and finding herself alone, clutching the shards of a broken Trident. Beside her is the husk of what was probably once a human, Aime however has no memory of the event nor any event prior to awakening. She stumbles towards the shore, finds a boat and rows across the sea towards the far shore.
- Once in Virmarr, looking for the Chancellor in the tavern.
	- Everyone splits up to look around
		- Get into some small scenarios
	- Either Jasper or Bismuth will find the Chancellor, who is seated with his daughter Hinelle and Duska, their Cleric. 
- The party stays the night in Virmarr.
- Cut to one of Alfread's decendents
	- Introduce Tom as this character
	- go through the motions
- Cut back to the present day,
