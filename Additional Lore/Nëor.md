Sap harvested from the [[The Brokvar-Coeden]]. This sap is widely known to have healing properties.

---

A unique and unsettling substance. The Brokvar Tree feeds on the nutrients and energy of the corpses buried beneath its roots by strongly devoted NÃ«orites.

The sap has a strong, aromatic smell, reminiscent of fresh spring and pine. The people of the Brokvar believe that it can grant immortality to those who consume it, while others claim that it can bring those with the strongest of faiths back from the dead.

Among continentals it is rumoured that those who use it too freely or recklessly may attract the attention of malevolent spirits and entities from the beyond and therefore, despite its potentially desirable effects, the tree sap is considered taboo and is largely shunned by the rest of the continent. Those who traffic in it are viewed as foul practitioners, and possession of the sap is often grounds for suspicion and persecution outside of Brokvar's steadfast mountain walls.

Whether the tree sap is a blessing or a curse is a matter of debate, but one thing is certain: it is a substance that should be approached with caution and reverence, for it holds the power of life and death in its sticky, purple embrace.
