A small and unassuming flower, with delicate yellow petals and thin, wispy stamen. It is a common sight in both gardens and meadows, often growing wild and unnoticed among other plants.

Despite its mundane appearance, the Etheria plant holds a secret power within its roots. The roots of the Etheria plant can be used to create a potent anaesthetic drug known commonly as [[Effiria]]. The drug is highly sought after by healers and alchemists, as it is known to have powerful anaesthetic properties, able to numb pain and induce a state of unconsciousness.

The Etheria plant is easy to grow and cultivate, making it and its derivative tincture a popular choice among medical practitioners. It is a hardy plant, able to withstand a variety of climates and conditions, and its small size helps it remain unnoticed by wildlife.

Despite its usefulness, the Etheria plant is also heavily regulated in many areas, as the drug it produces can be incredibly dangerous if used improperly. Those who seek to obtain Etheria must acquire it via a medical practitioner or risk facing criminal charges.
