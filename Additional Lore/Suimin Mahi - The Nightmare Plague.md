This fungal plague was brought to the continent on the slave ship captained by Captain Vang. The Twin "Patient Zero"s Jasper and Bismuth were amongst the slaves brought from the east. Due to their Djinn powers, the pair of them are immune and have been carrying the infection for several years. They originally picked it up while exploring an underground fungal forest.

Suimin Mahi symptoms include restless sleeping, a purple rash and crystallisation of the adipose tissue. (Mostly undetectable in the early stages).

The first stage of symptoms once developed lasts throughout the whole of the cycle of fungal development - The transition from the first to second stage can take anywhere from a couple days to a couple months. (Meta side note: The first stage of development can last for as long as a year, by which point the Suimin Mahi will have either died or be ready to move on the second stage of development.) 

The second stage of development is a symptom of chrysalis conditions being prepared, as the body fights back and rejects the toxins and tendrils being spread throughout it. 

Entering the chrysalis phase, the body begins to convert to perfect chrysalis conditions. The adipose tissue begins to crystallise.
