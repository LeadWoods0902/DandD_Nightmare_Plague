A powerful anaesthetic tincture, created from the ground roots of the Etheria plant. It is a clear, viscous liquid, with a slightly sweet and floral aroma. When ingested or applied topically, Etheria quickly takes effect, numbing pain and providing relief. When ingested it also has the effect of easing one into unconsciousness.  

Etheria is highly valued by healers and alchemists, as it is a potent and effective means of relieving pain and inducing sleep. It is often used in surgeries and other medical procedures, as well as in the treatment of severe injuries and chronic pain.

It is not uncommon for wealthy individuals to take large amounts of Etheria before their death, in order to ease their passing and ensure a painless end. This practice is controversial, as it raises ethical questions about the use of the drug and the motivations behind it.

However, Etheria is also a powerful and potentially dangerous substance. It can cause side effects such as dizziness, nausea, and impaired motor function, and it can be addictive if used in large doses or over a long period of time. 

It is highly regulated in imperial controlled areas, and possession or use of the drug without proper authorisation can result in criminal charges.
