Beasts capable of transforming into humans, when in human form they bear tattoo-like markings that resemble their true animalistic nature.

These markings draw from a range of options and sizes:
- Teeth / Fangs
- Facial markings
- Eyes
- Body tattoos
- arm tattoos

An exemplar rune **Bear** humanoid may have short teeth like markings near the corner of they're mouth as well as wide rings around their eyes. Additionally this humanoid would have long hair and a thick beard. 

An exemplar rune **Wolf** humanoid may have long fangs and slicked back hair

An exemplar run **Shark** humanoid may have gill like tattoos and a zigzagging tattoo across their torso, reminiscent of a shark bite.
