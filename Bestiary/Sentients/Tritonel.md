### Physical Characteristics:

##### Appearance: Hippocampi are graceful, slender humanoids with smooth, iridescent scales in vibrant colors like turquoise, coral pink, or shimmering silver. Their upper bodies resemble humanoids, while their lower bodies extend into the form of a seahorse, complete with a prehensile tail and a dorsal fin.
##### Tail and Fins: Their tails are strong and flexible, allowing them to navigate both land and water with ease. Dorsal fins run down their backs and can be used for balance, steering, or even as a form of self-defense.
    ##### Gill Slits: Hippocampi possess gill slits on their necks, which enable them to extract oxygen from water. They can breathe both air and water, making them equally comfortable in both environments.
    Webbed Hands and Feet: Their hands and feet are webbed, providing them with excellent swimming abilities.
    Eyes: Hippocampi have large, expressive eyes adapted for low-light conditions, helping them see clearly both underwater and on land.
