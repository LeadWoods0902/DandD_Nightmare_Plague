The Echo Snapper is a unique and formidable creature, it carries a large, air-filled shell on its back. It possess a powerful ability to release this air in a deafening clap and blast of wind that can break bones, making it a formidable predator and a formidable defence mechanism. It is a solitary creature that lives in rocky coastal areas, using its unique ability to surprise and hunt its prey or defend itself from predators.

A close relative of the hermit crab, Echo Snappers spend most of their youth looking for the perfect shell. Unlike hermit crabs, they do not live in this shell, instead using it as a weapon: this species has evolved to have an external lung valve, allowing it to fill its shell with air. Filling the shell takes a long time as the Echo Snapper has only small lungs. A tissue like seal is formed on the exit of the shell, preventing an early discharge.
