A Helioclasm's body appears to be a swirling mass of living flame, with hues ranging from golden yellow to deep crimson. Its form dances and shifts, leaving trails of searing sparks in its wake.

The air around the Helioclasm shimmers with intense heat, creating a stifling atmosphere for any who draw near. Its presence alone can ignite flammable materials in close proximity.

Immune to conventional fire-based attacks, the Helioclasm draws strength from the sun's energy. It can walk through lava flows and survive in the heart of volcanic eruptions unscathed.

As the Helioclasm moves, it leaves behind a trail of scorched earth and smoldering embers. Its passage is marked by a wake of destruction, leaving behind a landscape transformed by intense heat.

When provoked, the Helioclasm can unleash devastating bursts of solar energy, sending forth searing beams of light and heat capable of melting even the sturdiest of materials.
