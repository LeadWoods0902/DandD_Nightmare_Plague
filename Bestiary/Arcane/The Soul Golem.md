***Soul Drain.*** The Soul Golem must drain the life force from living creatures to sustain itself. As a bonus action, it can make a melee attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage, and the Soul Golem regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature's soul is absorbed into the Soul Golem, increasing the size and color of its geode.

***Multiattack.*** The Soul Golem makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage.

***Soulburst (Recharge 5-6).*** The Soul Golem releases a burst of necrotic energy in a 30-foot radius centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The Soul Golem regains hit points equal to half the total damage dealt by this ability.

***Soulbound Resistance.*** Whenever the Soul Golem is targeted by a spell or magical effect that would force it to make a saving throw, it can choose to absorb a soul it has collected to gain advantage on the saving throw. If it succeeds, the absorbed soul is consumed.

***Geode Growth.*** The size and color of the geode in the Soul Golem's chest cavity represent its age and power. At the start of its turn, the Soul Golem regains hit points equal to its geode's size (2d6). The geode starts as small and colorless and increases in size and color as the Soul Golem collects souls.

**Actions**

***Soul Infusion.*** The Soul Golem targets one creature within 60 feet of it that it can see. The target must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be afflicted with the Soulbound condition. A creature afflicted with the Soulbound condition takes 2d10 psychic damage at the start of its turn for 1 minute. The Soul Golem can maintain concentration on up to three afflicted creatures simultaneously. The affected creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect.

***Summon Soul Fragments.*** The Soul Golem summons 1d4 Soul Fragments to aid it in battle. These fragments have the stats of Shadows (MM 269). The Soul Fragments are under the control of the Soul Golem and act immediately after it in the initiative order.

**Legendary Actions**

The Soul Golem can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Soul Golem regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Soul Drain.*** The Soul Golem uses its Soul Drain ability.

***Soul Quake (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Soul Golem causes the ground to tremble, creating a shockwave in a 30-foot radius centered on itself. All creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Soulburst (Costs 3 Actions).*** The Soul Golem uses its Soulburst ability.
