	- This will be getting some homebrew buffs

### The Divine Diplomat

Born into a noble family, you were brought up under the gaze of the twin sun. Literally, because from Sunmaek you can see two suns in the sky and figuratively because you grew up within the "church of the sun" (name tbc) and were cared for deeply by its two leaders **the sun's twin pontiffs**.

After spending many years training as a cleric, you were bestowed the title of "gench-kisi" - a unique title that anyone from Sunmaek would recognise. Before the start of the campaign,  a meeting is called for between Brokvar and Sunmaek (Two nations with an entwined history). Your father Chancellor Sturgis was enlisted on to the meeting council as a representative of the state and the church and as both his daughter and the "gench-kisi", you are expected to come to Brokvar with him.

**Spoilers from here until the next major heading**

While on the road to Brokvar, your father is taken hostage by Bandits and you are left stranded in the Weald

**Motivation**: Reach Brokvar and make contact with the Sunmaek Embassy, finish the task that you and your father were sent to Brokvar to accomplish

### Pickpocket to Priest

Born on the streets of the second largest city of Sunmaek, it was a do or die world. at age 13, you were caught attempting to pick the pockets of a "priest of the sun" - rather than raise the city watch, the priest offered you a position in his personal service. Initially you had little interest in the church, instead spending your time devising escape plans (you've become a critical thinker and master planner). However, after spending many months surrounded by positive energy, you found yourself entranced by the prospect of helping others - you decided to turn your life around, devoting yourself to a life of servitude to the twin gods rather than a life of despair and misery living on the streets.

You quickly rose through the ranks and became good friends with a noble's daughter - it was this that lead to you being chosen to join her honour party on her sea faring venture to Brokvar.

**Motivation**: Reach Brokvar and make contact with the Sunmaek Embassy, finish the task that you and your father were sent to Brokvar to accomplish
