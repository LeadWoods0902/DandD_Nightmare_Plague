### Sunmaekan Diplomat

Born into a noble family, you were brought up under the gaze of the twin sun. Literally, because from Sunmaek you can see two suns in the sky and figuratively because you grew up within the "church of the sun" (name tbc) and were cared for deeply by its two leaders **the sun's twin pontiffs**.

After spending many years training as a cleric, you were bestowed the title of "gen√ß lider" - a unique title that anyone from Sunmaek would recognise. Before the start of the campaign,  a peace meeting is called for between the nations of the world. Your father Chancellor Sturgis was enlisted as a representative of the state and the church. However, when the time comes, your father is no longer able to go and beseeches you to go,ntrusting you with documents and treaties to be signed

Due to a last minute complication, you have been sent in the stead of your adoptive father Chancellor Sturgis.
