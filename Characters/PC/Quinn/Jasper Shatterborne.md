### Character Info

##### Name 
Jasper Shatterborne


##### Description
With the sides of your head shaved, chestnut hair hangs down from the top of your head
The hair is artfully styled into a long braided high-set tail, which adds an element of elegance and practicality to their overall appearance.

Complementing their distinctive hairstyle is their warm golden skin, evoking a radiant glow akin to sunlight filtering through the foliage of a dense forest. Their earthy complexion exudes a natural charm and hints at a deep connection with the elements.

Accentuating their captivating features are eyes of a deep forest green, reminiscent of lush foliage and the tranquility found within secluded woodlands. These dark green eyes hold an air of wisdom and an innate connection to nature.

As for attire, your Genasi has a preference for a green knee-length belted jumpsuit, providing a perfect blend of comfort and functionality. Padded with light wooden plates around their hips and chest, their outfit offers a subtle layer of protection while allowing for freedom of movement. The jumpsuit's green hue complements their natural coloring, further harmonizing their connection with the natural world.
