The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or suffer necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier + your Paladin level. Additionally, the target's maximum hit points are reduced by the amount of damage dealt until it finishes a long rest.

Cursed Purge: Starting at 11th level, when you use Corrupted Touch, you have the option to expend one of your spell slots to amplify its effects. The target must make a Constitution saving throw with disadvantage against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target suffers additional necrotic damage equal to the level of the expended spell slot.

Aura of Affliction: At 15th level, your malevolent influence permeates your surroundings. The range of your Corrupted Touch feature increases to 10 feet. Additionally, hostile creatures that start their turn within this range suffer necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

Once per long rest, you can use Corrupted Touch on a fallen creature to return it to life as a vile undead servant. The creature becomes a loyal, mindless servant under your control, acting on your commands until destroyed.
