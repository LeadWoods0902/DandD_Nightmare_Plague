A Sorcerer's Apprentice

While his master was conducting a ritual to summon the spirits of long dead warriors, Alfread interrupted the ritual, creating a fissure that his master was sucked into - Alfread reached into the rift before it closed in an attempt to rescue his master but accidentally absorbed the souls of four descendants.
