### Backstory

Once a humble servant of the [[Master Librarian]] of the [[Sunmaek Royal Library]], Duska Halloni was a quiet, mostly reserved character and was content with their position. Along with being happy with their role, Dusk was well liked among by both the other library staff and Sunmaek's royalty. If it wasn't for  one unfortunate night, Dusk may have naturally risen to a greater position; however on one stormy night, Dusk made an unexpected discovery within the great halls of the royal library. A dark leather bound book, well weathered and beaten, the sort one would often discard to the back of a shelf or leave unnoticed in a dark corner - which is exactly where Dusk discovered it. And like a moth to the flame, Dusk found themselves delving into the pages of the book, uncovering an ancient and **abhorrent** history. A history laced with all manner of abhorrent horror, including many references to one "many faced god of death, [[Mortos]]".

After discovering this primordial text, Duska Von Mori began to search the library for more abandoned knowledge. Scouring every nook and cranny for similar tomes. This undying and sudden passion was noticed by two beings: the first being the master librarian, the second: Mortos themselves.

Whereas the Master Librarian admonished Duska's interests, Mortos welcomed them to their domain, granting them access to the cold folds of death. Ritualistic knowledge was bequeathed unto Duska and all that was required to grant Mortos' boon was a sacrifice...

Inconveniently for the Master Librarian, she had recently been giving Duska trouble, and once the ritual was complete, Duska arose anew as "*Von Mori*". With vampiric powers in hand, Duska manipulated their way into a position of greater power, unearthing more ancient tomes from deep within the vaults of forbidden knowledge in the process. Through the texts, Duska discovered the words of Mortos: 

>*"The inevitability of death is the greatest equalizer; immortality, in all its forms, threatens to upset the delicate balance of life and death. The cycle of life must continue, unbroken and unchallenged, for all time."*

Duska spent many years purging Sunmaek of the undeserving and the immortal, using their position to develop connections within the chancellorship. [[Hinele]], the daughter of the [[Chancellor Sturgis]] grew close to you after many years spent in the library - you've opted to exploit this relationship to get closer to the chancellor, and hopefully sway Hinele to your will.

When given the opportunity to travel to Seni with chancellor Sturgis and Hinele, you jumped at the opportunity. If only as an opportunity to spread your cold embrace and the word of Mortos.

### Special Magics

##### Zone of Deceit

You create an aura of dark magic that fills a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. This aura becomes a zone of deceit. Within this zone, creatures that enter or start their turn must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the zone. On a successful save, the creature is unaffected and can speak freely.

##### Accursed Bolt

You unleash a bolt of malevolent necrotic energy that streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 necrotic damage.

Additionally, the target is wreathed in dark, lingering energy. Until the end of its next turn, the target emits a sickly aura. Any attacks made against the target have advantage, and the target has disadvantage on all saving throws against necrotic damage.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
