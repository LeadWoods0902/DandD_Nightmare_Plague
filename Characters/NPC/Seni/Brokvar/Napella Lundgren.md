### Notes

Ancient Queen of Brokvar. 

Entombed within the roots of the Nëor Tree.

Napella was a warrior queen of legend, renowned for her bravery and skill in battle. She was the leader of a fierce and powerful army, feared by her enemies and revered by her subjects.

Etched with the scars of countless battles, her face was framed by a flowing crop of burnished copper hair. Protecting her slender and tall body, she wore a suit of armour that shone like the sun, adorned with the insignia of her kingdom: a pair of bears stood on their hind legs under an ashen tree.

*Her crown bore the [[Engraved Emerald]], a stone she was never seen without.*

In combat, Napella was a force to be reckoned with. She wielded a small curved Flamberge with a blade that shimmered blood red; imbued with powerful enchantments that made it searing hot to the touch, this legendary weapon is renowned for its bloody history.

Napella was a strong believer in the adage "fight fire with fire," and was not afraid of the necessary extreme measures required to achieve her goals. She was known for her ruthless tactics of destroying her enemies completely, employing the use of napalm to scorch her enemies and conquer their lands; leaving no room for rebellion or resistance. This earned her the nickname "The Napalm Queen" striking fear into the hearts of those who opposed her rule.

Despite her fierce reputation as a militaristic leader, Napella was known to be kind and considerate beyond expectation to her subjects, ruling her kingdom with wisdom and compassion. She was loved by her people and while her name struck fear into the hearts of all who opposed her she was respected greatly by the whole continent.

Napella's legend lived on long after her death, with tales of her bravery and greatness told and retold throughout the ages. She remains an iconic figure, remembered as a symbol of strength and courage, and a shining example of what it means to be a true warrior queen.

The love for Napella was so strong in fact that a sub group of the Brokvar population built a new city, abandoning their faith in Nëoris who'm they felt abandoned their Queen.

Napella's body was recovered an in an autopsy it was discovered that she was pregnant - signs indicate that despite her carrying a stillborn child another may have been born before her death, this fact was kept from the public.
