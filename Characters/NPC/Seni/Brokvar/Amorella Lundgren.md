### Notes

Amorella grew up in hiding, never fully understanding the circumstances of her mother's past or the significance of the emerald that she had been entrusted with. She lived a simple life, working as a seamstress in a small fishing hamlet: eventually raising her daughter, Lupella, with her husband [[Ayven Torrieth]]. 

Amorella grew up with little knowledge of her mother, [[Napella Lundgren]], bar that she was the queen of Brokvar - a not far off city of grandeur that would forever remain out of reach. As her daughter Lupella grew older, she found herself being begged ever more often for tales of her parents, the late Napella and [[Ven-Dryk Ashahalla]]. With intense reluctance, Amorella promised to take Lupella to the capital on her 21st name day to see the city of her family's construction. On the condition that she understood that seeking out the life she was entitled to by birth right would only lead to a quick death. 

However, when Lupella was just a teenager, disaster struck. Their small village was raided by pirates, and both Amorella and Ayven were killed trying to protect their daughter. Amorella's final words stuck with Lupella for life: 

*"Oh, my dear daughter. I am so sorry for all the mistakes that I made in my life. I should have stood up for what I believed in, instead of hiding away in fear and complacency.*

*And remember, my child, you are the rightful queen of Brokvar, descended from the great warrior queen Napella. And I will not rest easy until I know that you are sitting on that throne, ruling with strength and honour.*

*I know that it will not be easy for you to claim your rightful place as queen of Brokvar. There will be those who will try to stand in your way, who will do everything they can to keep you from the throne. But do not let them discourage you. With patience and the right allies, you can overcome any obstacle.*

*Do not make the same mistakes that I did. Be bold, be brave, and never let anyone tell you that you are not worthy of greatness. You are destined for greatness, my dear. Do not let anything stand in your way. I love you."*

Ripped from her mother, Lupella was taken captive by the pirates and forced into servitude as a sword bearer. Despite an initial reluctance for bloodshed, Lupella proved to be a fierce and skilled warrior. Quickly rising through the ranks of the pirates, earning the respect and loyalty of her fellow crewmates.

**something something find a true love for piracy, vow to sit the throne before she dies but take control of her life and do something she both enjoys and is good at something something**

As she gained power and influence, Lupella began to dream of something more. She yearned to lead her own crew and make a name for herself in the world of piracy. And so, she set out to gather her own band of loyal followers, eventually becoming the notorious Reaver Queen, the pirate lord of the northern seas.

As she sailed the seas and plundered the riches of the world, Lupella never forgot about her grandmother and the legacy that she had inherited. She carried the emerald with her always, hoping that one day it would help her to reclaim her rightful place as the queen of Brokvar.

**By the time party meet her, she is in her late 50s - a shell of her former self but the same age that Napella was when she snuffed out the bloody civil war that allowed the empire to step into the country.**
