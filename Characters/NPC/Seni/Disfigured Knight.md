### Notes

This iron-clad knight is a formidable figure, clad in heavy, obscuring armour that covers every inch of his body. His helm is thick and crudely constructed, with long flowing hair at its rear. The knight's armour is iron painted in a chipping murky black, with splashes of red ochre on the breastplate, as if a bloody hand had been smeared down it.

The knight wields a massive two-handed morning star, its entire length studded with metal spikes that make it difficult to grasp for those without armour. The knight is built like a boar, with a thick and sturdy frame, and he breathes heavily as if exerting great effort even when at rest.

Despite his intimidating appearance, little is known about this knight, his identity and motivations shrouded in secrecy; he is a mystery to all but a select few. However, one thing is certain: anyone who crosses his path would do well to beware, for the knight is a formidable opponent, despite his injuries, wielding his heavy morning star with deadly precision.

His origins are equally shrouded in mystery: all that is known is that the knight emerged from the ashes of a terrible blaze, screaming in agony, his body fused to the heavy armour he still wears to this day: the armour is now a part of him, a twisted and grotesque reflection of his former self.

He is a solitary figure, wandering the land seeking battle to prove his worth and bring justice to the world. Over time, he has become known as the iron-clad knight, a fierce and relentless fighter whose name strikes fear into the hearts of his enemies. No one knows what drives him, or what he hopes to accomplish. All that is certain is that he is a force to be reckoned with, a warrior whose strength and skill are unmatched.

"I will never forget the day that we were caught in that terrible fire. I was the only one to survive, and I hate myself for it. I will do everything in my power to honour the memory of... to honour **their** memory, even if it means breaking my vows to do so. I will not rest until I have brought those responsible for their deaths to justice, and I will spare no mercy for those who stand in my way. I am so full of... but I will not let it consume me. I will channel it into my rage, and use it to fuel my quest for vengeance... My quest for **JUSTICE**"
