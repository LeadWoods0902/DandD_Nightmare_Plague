Daughter of [[Napella Lundgren]] and [[Ven-Dryk Lungdren]], Mother of [[Lupella Lundgren]] and wife of [[Ayven Torrieth]]

Amorella grew up in hiding, never fully understanding the circumstances of her mother's past or the significance of the emerald that she had been entrusted with. She lived a simple life, working as a seamstress and raising her daughter Lupella on her own.

As her daughter Lupella grew older, she found herself being often begged to tell stories of her mother, the legendary Napella, for Lupella dreamed of one day 

When Lupella was just a teenager, disaster struck. Their small village was raided by pirates, and Napella was killed trying to protect her daughter. Lupella was taken captive and forced to join the pirates, serving as a member of their crew.

Despite her initial reluctance, Lupella proved to be a fierce and skilled warrior. She quickly rose through the ranks of the pirates, earning the respect and loyalty of her fellow crewmates.

As she gained power and influence, Lupella began to dream of something more. She yearned to lead her own crew and make a name for herself in the world of piracy. And so, she set out to gather her own band of loyal followers, eventually becoming the notorious Reaver Queen, the pirate lord of the northern seas.

As she sailed the seas and plundered the riches of the world, Lupella never forgot about her grandmother and the legacy that she had inherited. She carried the emerald with her always, hoping that one day it would help her to reclaim her rightful place as the queen of Brokvar.
