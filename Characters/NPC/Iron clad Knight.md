This iron-clad knight is a formidable figure, clad in heavy, obscuring armour that covers every inch of his body. His helm is thick and crudely constructed, with long flowing hair at its rear. The knight's armour is a combination of dark, murky black and iron, with splashes of red ochre on the breastplate, as if a bloody hand had been smeared down it.

The knight wields a massive two-handed morning star, its entire length studded with metal rivets that make it difficult to grasp for those without armour. The knight is built like a boar, with a thick and sturdy frame, and he breathes heavily, as if exerting great effort even when at rest.

Despite his intimidating appearance, little is known about the iron-clad knight. He is a mystery to all but a select few, his identity and motivations shrouded in secrecy. However, one thing is certain: anyone who crosses his path would do well to beware, for the knight is a formidable opponent, wielding his heavy morning star with deadly precision.
