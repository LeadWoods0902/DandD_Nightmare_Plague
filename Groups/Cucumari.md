### Physical Characteristics

##### Appearance
Cucumari appear as tall, slender humanoids with smooth, rubbery, and semi-translucent skin in various shades of blue, green, or purple. Their bodies are somewhat cylindrical, tapering towards their lower halves.

Tentacle Appendages: They have a cluster of tentacle-like appendages that replace their hair, which they can manipulate for various tasks, such as sensing vibrations, manipulating objects, or even attacking.
    Water Adaptations: Cucumari have gill-like structures on their necks, which enable them to extract oxygen from water. They can breathe both air and water, making them equally comfortable in both environments.
    Elongated Arms and Fingers: Their arms and fingers are elongated and dexterous, perfect for fine motor skills and underwater activities.
    Eyeless: Cucumari have no visible eyes but possess a keen sense of echolocation and vibration detection, allowing them to "see" their surroundings by sensing vibrations in the water or ground.
