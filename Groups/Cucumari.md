Cucumari appear as tall, slender humanoids with smooth, rubbery, and semi-translucent skin in various shades of blue, green, or purple. Their bodies are somewhat cylindrical, tapering towards their lower halves.
##### Tentacle Appendages
They have a cluster of tentacle-like appendages that replace their hair, which they can manipulate for various tasks, such as sensing vibrations, manipulating objects, or even attacking.

##### Elongated Arms and Fingers
Their arms and fingers are elongated and dexterous, perfect for fine motor skills and underwater activities.

##### Eyeless
Cucumari have no visible eyes but possess a keen sense of echolocation and vibration detection, allowing them to "see" their surroundings by sensing vibrations in the water or ground.
