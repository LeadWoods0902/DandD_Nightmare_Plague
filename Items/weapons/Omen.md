![[Omen.png]]
A sword of [[Sunmaek]] legend, thought to be lost for millennia, the sword was retrieved by [[Duska Von Mori]] under the guidance of [[Mortos]]. 

Omen, when wielded in the name of The Twins, emanates a radiant light of such intensity that it has the power to blind and disorient its adversaries. Alternatively, when infused with the ink of Mortos, the blade becomes a conduit for necrotic energy, draining the life force of both its wielder and its unfortunate victims.

Regardless of its state, the sword possesses the ability to be projected and manipulated from a distance. This is accomplished by focusing one's concentration on the ethereal form that remains within the hand of its possessor.
