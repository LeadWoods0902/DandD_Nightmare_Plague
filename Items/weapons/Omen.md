![[Omen.png]]
A sword of [[Sunmaek]] legend, thought to be lost for millennia, the sword was retrieved by [[Duska Von Mori]] under the guidance of [[Mortos]]. 

Omen, when wielded in the name of The Twins, emanates a radiant light of such intensity that it has the power to blind and disorient its adversaries. Alternatively, when infused with the ink of Mortos, the blade becomes a conduit for necrotic energy, draining the life force of both its wielder and its unfortunate victims.

Regardless of its state, the sword possesses the ability to be projected and manipulated from a distance. This is accomplished by focusing one's concentration on the ethereal form that remains within the hand of its possessor.

You project Omen onto the battlefield


You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spellâ€™s effect resemble that weapon.
