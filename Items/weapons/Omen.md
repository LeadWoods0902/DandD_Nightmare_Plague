![[Omen.png]]
A sword of [[Sunmaek]] legend, thought to be lost for millennia, the sword was retrieved by [[Duska Von Mori]] under the guidance of [[Mortos]]. 

When brandished in the name of [[The Twins]], Omen shines with a bright light capable of blinding it's enemies - when tainted with the ink of [[Mortos]], the blade is instead filled with necrotic energy and saps the life from both it's wielder and victims. 

In both forms, the sword can be sent out and controlled from a distance - done so by concentrating on the non-corporeal form that remains in their hand.
