Taken from the corpse of Protector Gabriel. "Nope, No Atar here... call me Gabriel."

**Thunder Shell**

Once per turn (and at the expense of one charge) as a ranged attack, this item launches a fine bolt of cacophonous noise. On a successful ranged attack, this item deals 3d4 resonant damage and 2d4 lightning damage. The sound can penetrate multiple targets, however targets after the first only take resonant damage equal to 3d4-x for every 5ft beyond the initial target.

**Point Blank Bang**

When attacking a target within 5ft, this weapon instead deals 5d6 bludgeoning damage and 2d4 lightning damage.

When upgraded with an air compressor, this item refills all of its charges on completion of a short rest. Additional charges can be acquired by loading the rifle with more modified [[Echo Snapper]] shells.
