Heyo, I had an idea for my campaign that I won't be using. Or at least not to the same extent - without spoiling too much it was going to revolve around druids. I've been thinking of turning it into a much shorter campaign with a much smaller scope. Would you be interested in something like this after my campaign? I know a few of you aren't enjoying my campaign so it's fine if you don't want to "commit" to another right now (obvs you wouldn't be committing anyway). But yeah, much tighter scope, shorter story
