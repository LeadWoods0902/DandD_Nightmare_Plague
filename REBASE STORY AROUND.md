#### Ten thousand years before the campaign starts

Musoko, being hunted by Soromo, cast his soul into a crystal and cast it to the wind - the crystal is lost to time

#### Two decades before the campaign starts

Calidian is on the war path and going slightly insane - goes to war with the rest of Senithar, leading to a civil war.

Napella attempts to end the war by launching an assault on the royal palace using a new weapon, Napalm.

The capital is destroyed and Vivienne dies along with Fenian's older brother who was set to be the emperor after his Father.

Enraged, Calidian goes to Brokvar in person and launches a siege on the capital. See [[The Butchering of Brokvar]]

Several years of empirical rule plague Senithar

#### A year before the campaign starts

After the death of Calidian, the empire defaults to the young Fenian. Fenian does a bad job of controlling the empire and they lose control of Marwolaeth in the latter end of the year.

Soromo's is discovered by Primalas, who sensing a strong connection to it takes into their possession and carries it with them to Senithar.

*During their travel, Musoko is drawn from hibernation and in a drowsy outburst they expend most of their remaining power and lay waste to the ship. Realising their fault, they establish a connection with Primalas, and urge them to flee.*

Arriving in Heinabergsar, Musoko departs the crystal leaving it empty and lifeless. They seek out someone of greater power and finds the ambitious Fenian, young empress of an expansive empire. Musoko shows Fenian has a vision of them ruling the whole of Senithar with an iron fist and establishes a symbitioc 

Musoko is not eating at Fenian's soul, but rather seeking a symbiotic relationship to share power and restore balance to Senithar?

Fenian's mental state is not a significant factor in his decision; instead, he is driven by a genuine belief that Musoko's assistance is crucial for the empire's survival.

*Musoko reveals himself in a partial living form, having been deprived of sustenance for oh so long. Musoko explains that given time and support, he can help Fenian regain control of Senithar and even the realms beyond. Little to Fenian's knowledge, Musoko is already eating at her soul. Due to their mental state, Fenian is easily influence and agrees to help restore Musoko to power. Fenian doesn't fully understand what Musoko is however.*

Musoko came *with* Bismuth & Jasper, in a weakened form.
