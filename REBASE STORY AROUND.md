#### Two decades before the campaign starts

Calidian is on the war path and going slightly insane - goes to war with the rest of Senithar, leading to a civil war.

Napella attempts to end the war by launching an assault on the royal palace using a new weapon, Napalm.

The capital is destroyed and Vivienne dies along with Fenian's older brother who was set to be the emperor after his Father.

Enraged, Calidian goes to Brokvar in person and launches a siege on the capital. See [[The Butchering of Brokvar]]

Several years of empirical rule plague Senithar

#### A year before the campaign starts

After the death of Calidian, the empire defaults to the young Fenian. Fenian does a bad job of controlling the empire and they lose control of Marwolaeth in the latter end of the year.

Musoko, currently being hunted by Soromo, cast his soul into a crystal and cast it to the wind - later the crystal is discovered by Primalas, who sensing a strong connection to it takes into their possession and carries it with them to Senithar.

During their travel, Musoko senses the power of the Coeden and his soul leaves the crystal, using the last of his power, he attempts to take control of the ship and use it to

Visited during the night, Fenian has a vision of them ruling the whole of Senithar with an iron fist. Musoko reveals himself in a partial living form, having been deprived of sustenance for oh so long. Musoko explains that given time and support, he can help Fenian regain control of Senithar and even the realms beyond. Little to Fenian's knowledge, Musoko is already eating at her soul. Due to their mental state, Fenian is easily influence and agrees to help restore Musoko to power. Fenian doesn't fully understand what Musoko is however. 

Musoko explains that the sap of the Coeden of Brokvar will give him the sustenance he needs, however he is too weak to make the journey, having used the last of his power to generate the vision.

Musoko was solely interested in gaining power from the Coeden, which he'd heard of but was too weak to travel there himself, so he had Fenian export the sap to the empirical capital where he is recovering.  


maybe?

*Musoko is not eating at Fenian's soul, but rather seeking a symbiotic relationship to share power and restore balance to Senithar?*

*Fenian's mental state is not a significant factor in his decision; instead, he is driven by a genuine belief that Musoko's assistance is crucial for the empire's survival.*



Musoko came *with* Bismuth & Jasper, in a weakened form.
