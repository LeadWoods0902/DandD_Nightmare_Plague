# Class Abilities
## Level 1: Trail Signs
Trailblazers can create subtle marks or signs to convey messages to others of their kind. These signs can indicate safe paths, hidden dangers, or the location of resources and shelters. Other Trailblazers, as well as those who have learned to read these signs, can easily interpret them.

You can create a trail sign in 1 minute, which lasts for 24 hours unless renewed. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Survival) check can reveal the signs to those not trained in the coded language.

While using this map, you and your allies have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to navigate the mapped area.

You can update your map by spending another 10 minutes to record any significant changes or discoveries, such as new paths or hazards.

Once per long rest, you can spend 1 hour to create a highly detailed map of an area up to 5 miles in radius. This map includes more precise details such as elevation changes, hidden entrances, and important locations.

# Trailblazer’s Coded Language
Trailblazers use a coded language of symbols and markings to communicate vital information about paths, dangers, and safe locations. Learning this language requires a dedicated mentor and can take months of practice. The symbols are often hidden in plain sight, carved into trees, painted on rocks, or subtly altered in the landscape. These marks can indicate anything from the direction to the nearest safe water source to warnings of dangerous creatures nearby.
