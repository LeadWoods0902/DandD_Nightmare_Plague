## Day 1
The Kilfenora is returning from Chimo to Senithar and while passing through the waters west of Brokvar, it is set upon by a strange magic: time seems to stop and strange smoke-like constructs that bear resemblance to masses of coiling tentacles. During a brief fight with the constructs: one of the crew members is wounded non-lethally and the captain manages to seemingly slay one of the constructs using his sword (which took on the appearance of a red hot coal during the fight). Seeing this, the constructs cease their attack and seemingly phase through the deck of the ship
