## Day 1
The Kilfenora is returning from Chimo to Senithar and while passing through the waters west of Brokvar, it is set upon by a strange magic: time seems to stop and strange smoke-like constructs that bear resemblance to masses of coiling tentacles. During a brief fight with the constructs: one of the crew members is wounded non-lethally and the captain (Nomli Gurglegum) manages to seemingly slay one of the constructs using his sword (which took on the appearance of a red hot coal during the fight). Seeing this, the constructs cease their attack and seemingly phase through the deck of the ship. Giving chase, Nomli Gurglegum leaps through an open hatch in the deck, propelling himself into a dense fog that quickly filled the room below. The crew takes a moment to catch their breath before splitting in two: one group remains top-side to tend to the injured member of the group while the others follow the lieutenant (Herouk Barrelbasher) below deck
