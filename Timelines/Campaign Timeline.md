## Day 1 - [[Session 1]]
The Kilfenora is returning from Chimo to Senithar and while passing through the waters west of Brokvar, it is set upon by a strange magic: time seems to stop and strange smoke-like constructs that bear resemblance to masses of coiling tentacles. During a brief fight with the constructs: one of the crew members (Magnus) is wounded non-lethally and the captain (Nomli Gurglegum) manages to seemingly slay one of the constructs using his sword (which took on the appearance of a red hot coal during the fight). Seeing this, the constructs cease their attack and seemingly phase through the deck of the ship. Giving chase, Nomli Gurglegum leaps through an open hatch in the deck, propelling himself into a dense fog that quickly filled the room below. The crew takes a moment to catch their breath before splitting in two: one group remains top-side to tend to the injured member of the group while the others follow the lieutenant (Herouk BarrelBasher) below deck. Above deck, the other group attempt to tend to Magnus' wound - feigning a trip to the medical store, Isabella makes a dash for one of the safety boats; however she is spotted by Magnus and Thorkil who also make it to the safety boats (Magnus in one and Thorkil and Isabella in the other).

While traversing the narrow and unlit corridor (presumably caused by the smoke constructs) leading to the hold, the party checks comes across a gory sight - one of the other members of the crew (Mordin), dead in their bed - seemingly killed via some oral attack due to a similar discolouration of the flesh around the lips and inner mouth as was seen around the wound Magnus took during the fight earlier. While inspecting Mordin, the group see a strange hooded figure dash past the open door, when they get to the door way they cannot see him in the corridor; other than the character's heavy brown cloak the only other discerning feature is a large golden brooch pinning the hood to the cloak. After leaving the room, the group head further down into the ship, eventually ending up outside the cargo hold. Looking through a crack in the door, they can only see a thick heavy fog on the floor and high stacks of crates and other cargo. Herouk bashes the door down and rushes in, before the rest of the group even make it across the threshold, they hear Herouk fall to the floor and begin to sob. Rounding a corner in the like hold, the group see Herouk crouched down over the unmistakable dress of Nomli - an emerald overcoat studded with obsidian spikes. Additionally, for the first time since leaving port, the group see the truth of the cargo they were carrying: slaves. Five creatures lay chained to the floor of the hold: two Genasi, two Centaur and one Tabaxi. Appalled by this knowledge, Herouk cuts a deal with the group: aid him in getting to shore and dealing with the cargo and any profits made are theirs to keep - explaining that it'd be best to sell the slaves off to coastal farms or a Brokvarian noble-person so as to lessen the chances of news of their failure to deliver the cargo to the empire reaching said empire. Hopefully they'd be able to split and assume knew lives for themselves far from the reaches of the Ymerodrol Empire.
